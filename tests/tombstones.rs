// Pure helper used by `test_tombstones_no_stability_docs_violations` to
// enforce the literal-tombstone stability checklist from
// `.claude/rules/tombstone-tests.md` "Literal tombstones — stability
// checklist". For every `#[test] fn` whose body (between the function's
// matching braces) contains a `.contains(` call (the byte-substring
// shape) AND whose preceding `///` doc block carries one or more
// `Tombstone:.*?PR #N` markers with the highest N at or above the
// sentinel PR, the helper checks the doc block for a stability
// argument — case-insensitive match on the macro forms `concat!` or
// `format!`, or the substring `constant`. A tombstone above the
// sentinel that uses a byte-substring assertion without at least one
// of those keywords in its doc block is a violation.
//
// Edge cases handled:
//
// - Body extraction tracks brace depth so the `.contains(` check
//   only sees the function's actual body, not interstitial helpers
//   or the next test's preceding doc block.
// - The walk regex tolerates zero or more intervening attributes
//   between `#[test]` and `fn` so a stacked second attribute
//   cannot bypass enforcement.
// - The doc-block walker tolerates one or more blank lines between
//   the `///` block and the `#[test]` attribute; rustdoc still
//   attaches the doc block across one blank line.
// - When multiple `Tombstone:.*?PR #N` markers appear in the same
//   doc block, the highest PR number wins (so an in-scope marker
//   stacked second cannot be hidden by a stale below-sentinel
//   marker stacked first).
// - PR-number parse failure (overflow beyond `u32::MAX`) fails
//   closed: the marker is treated as in-scope per
//   `.claude/rules/security-gates.md` "Fail Closed When State Is
//   Unreliable".
//
// Known-fuzzy keyword: the `constant` substring may match prose
// containing words like `constant-time` or `constants`. Authors who
// invoke `concat!` and `format!` in their stability argument
// (the canonical first two checklist items) trigger the more-
// specific macro-form keywords and avoid the fuzzy substring
// surface entirely.
//
// The sentinel scopes enforcement to tombstones at or above
// `STABILITY_DOCS_SENTINEL_PR`. Tombstones below the sentinel are
// out of scope — retrofitting `///` blocks onto every existing
// byte-substring tombstone would expand the diff far past the
// rule the contract test enforces forward.

/// Sentinel PR number for `test_tombstones_no_stability_docs_violations`.
///
/// Tombstones whose `Tombstone:.*?PR #N` marker has N at or above this
/// value MUST carry a `///` doc block that mentions `concat!`,
/// `format!`, or `constant` (case-insensitive). Tombstones below the
/// sentinel predate the stability-docs requirement and are out of
/// scope; the contract test does not retroactively flag them.
///
/// When raising the sentinel — typically after a campaign that
/// retrofits `///` blocks onto older byte-substring tombstones —
/// update the value here and verify every newly-in-scope tombstone
/// passes the contract test before committing.

///      surfaces in prose or config eventually.
///   3. Named constant reference: a `const PHASE_LABEL: &str =

///      literal in a constant whose value still produces the
///      forbidden substring at compile time, but the constant
