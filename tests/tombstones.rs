// Pure helper used by `test_tombstones_no_naming_violations` to enforce
// the tombstone naming convention from `.claude/rules/tombstone-tests.md`
// "Naming Convention". Walks `#[test] fn <name>(` declarations in the
// supplied content and flags any name that does not match the regex
// `^test_[a-z][a-z0-9_]*_no_[a-z][a-z0-9_]*$` (the literal form of the
// `test_<scope>_no_<removed_thing>` pattern). Names listed in the
// `exclusions` slice are skipped — used by the contract test for the
// two contract tests themselves whose names are part of the rule's
// own implementation rather than tombstones.
//
// The walk regex tolerates zero or more intervening attributes
// between `#[test]` and `fn` so an author cannot bypass naming
// enforcement by stacking a second attribute (such as
// should_panic or other test-runner directives). The walk does
// NOT distinguish `#[test]` inside raw string literals from a
// real attribute — fixtures that need to emit the literal in
// source must use the `concat!` escape (see
// `tests/test_placement.rs::src_contains_no_inline_cfg_test_blocks`
// for the canonical pattern).

//
// Pure helper used by `test_tombstones_no_stability_docs_violations` to
// enforce the literal-tombstone stability checklist from
// `.claude/rules/tombstone-tests.md` "Literal tombstones — stability
// checklist". For every `#[test] fn` whose body (between the function's
// matching braces) contains a `.contains(` call (the byte-substring
// shape) AND whose preceding `///` doc block carries one or more
// `Tombstone:.*?PR #N` markers with the highest N at or above the
// sentinel PR, the helper checks the doc block for a stability
// argument — case-insensitive match on the macro forms `concat!` or
// `format!`, or the substring `constant`. A tombstone above the
// sentinel that uses a byte-substring assertion without at least one
// of those keywords in its doc block is a violation.
//
// Edge cases handled:
//
// - Body extraction tracks brace depth so the `.contains(` check
//   only sees the function's actual body, not interstitial helpers
//   or the next test's preceding doc block.
// - The walk regex tolerates zero or more intervening attributes
//   between `#[test]` and `fn` so a stacked second attribute
//   cannot bypass enforcement.
// - The doc-block walker tolerates one or more blank lines between
//   the `///` block and the `#[test]` attribute; rustdoc still
//   attaches the doc block across one blank line.
// - When multiple `Tombstone:.*?PR #N` markers appear in the same
//   doc block, the highest PR number wins (so an in-scope marker
//   stacked second cannot be hidden by a stale below-sentinel
//   marker stacked first).
// - PR-number parse failure (overflow beyond `u32::MAX`) fails
//   closed: the marker is treated as in-scope per
//   `.claude/rules/security-gates.md` "Fail Closed When State Is
//   Unreliable".
//
// Known-fuzzy keyword: the `constant` substring may match prose
// containing words like `constant-time` or `constants`. Authors who
// invoke `concat!` and `format!` in their stability argument
// (the canonical first two checklist items) trigger the more-
// specific macro-form keywords and avoid the fuzzy substring
// surface entirely.
//
// The sentinel scopes enforcement to tombstones at or above
// `STABILITY_DOCS_SENTINEL_PR`. Tombstones below the sentinel are
// out of scope — retrofitting `///` blocks onto every existing
// byte-substring tombstone would expand the diff far past the
// rule the contract test enforces forward.

/// Sentinel PR number for `test_tombstones_no_stability_docs_violations`.
///
/// Tombstones whose `Tombstone:.*?PR #N` marker has N at or above this
/// value MUST carry a `///` doc block that mentions `concat!`,
/// `format!`, or `constant` (case-insensitive). Tombstones below the
/// sentinel predate the stability-docs requirement and are out of
/// scope; the contract test does not retroactively flag them.
///
/// When raising the sentinel — typically after a campaign that

/// legitimate prose drift.

/// `CODE_REVIEW`, `CODE-REVIEW`, `CodeReview` — anywhere in the
/// working tree. The walker invokes
/// `git ls-files` via `std::process::Command` so the scan respects
/// `.gitignore` and skips untracked artifacts (build output, IDE
/// scratch files, `.flow-states/`).
///
/// The forbidden literals are built via `concat!` so the search
/// strings do not themselves appear as plain substrings in this
/// source file — otherwise the scanner would flag itself before
/// the self-exclude logic could apply. The self-exclude is a

/// path, matching the pattern used by
/// `test_rust_source_no_backward_facing_comments` above.
///
/// The byte-substring shape holds because:
///   1. `concat!` reassembly: the only known bypass is the same
///      `concat!` technique this test itself uses internally; any

///      consumer that ultimately serializes it back into prose or
///      a config file, where this scanner would catch it on the
///      next CI run.
///   2. `format!` reassembly: same as above — runtime synthesis
///      surfaces in prose or config eventually.
///   3. Named constant reference: a `const PHASE_LABEL: &str =
///      concat!("Code", " ", "Review")` would centralize the
///      literal in a constant whose value still produces the
///      forbidden substring at compile time, but the constant
///      definition itself would appear in source as a `concat!`
///      call that does NOT trip the scanner. This is the one
///      acceptable carve-out and is the same technique this
///      test uses to embed the forbidden literals.
///   4. Method chains / split args: the substring check operates
///      on file content, not on source-level syntax, so any code
///      whose runtime effect is to emit one of the forbidden
///      fragments into a tracked file (a SKILL.md, a doc, a JSON
///      value) is caught regardless of how the source assembles
