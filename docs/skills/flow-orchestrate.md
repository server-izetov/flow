# /flow-orchestrate

**Phase:** Any

**Usage:** `/flow-orchestrate`

Processes decomposed issues sequentially overnight via `flow-start`. Fetches open issues labeled "Decomposed", filters out in-progress issues, and runs the full Start → Code → Review → Complete lifecycle for each one. Autonomy comes from the project's `.flow.json` `skills` config — for unattended runs, configure it with the "Fully autonomous" preset from `/flow-prime`. Generates a morning report with results.

## What It Does

1. Fetches open issues with the "Decomposed" label, excludes those with "Flow In-Progress"
2. Displays a queue table with `Order`, `Issue #`, and `Title` columns sorted by issue number descending, and creates an orchestration state file at `.flow-states/orchestrate.json`
3. For each issue in the queue:
   - Invokes `flow-start` with the issue number
   - The full 4-phase lifecycle runs, each phase resolving autonomy from `.flow.json`
   - Detects the outcome from GitHub PR state (merged = completed, closed = failed)
   - Cleans up stuck features via `flow-abort` if needed
4. Marks the orchestration complete
5. Generates a summary report at `.flow-states/orchestrate-summary.md`

---

## Morning Report

The report is delivered in two ways:

- **End of session:** Rendered inline after the last issue completes
- **Next session start:** Not currently available (session-start delivery was removed in PR #938)

---

## Compaction Survival

The orchestrator state file (`.flow-states/orchestrate.json`) tracks the queue position and per-issue outcomes. Self-invocation after each feature keeps the working context bounded.

---

## Multi-Run Lifecycle

The "Decomposed" label is the queue:

- **Completed issues** are closed by `flow-complete` and excluded from the next run
- **Failed issues** retain the label and re-enter the queue on subsequent runs
- **New issues** decomposed during the day enter automatically

No configuration or manual queue management needed.

## Gates

- One orchestration per machine at a time (state file acts as lock)
- No parallel issue processing — sequential only
- No retries for failed issues in V1
