# /flow-explore

**Phase:** Any (standalone)

**Usage:**

```text
/flow:flow-explore <topic>
```

Opens a problem-statement conversation about something the user wants to build, fix, or change. The skill stays in discussion mode by default — surfacing clarifying questions, exploring prior issues, identifying the user-visible outcome — and dispatches to PM, Tech Lead, or CTO planning sub-agents only on explicit user request. When the user signals "ready" or "file it", the skill captures the agreed problem statement as a vanilla GitHub issue (`## What`, `## Why`, `## Acceptance Criteria`) without an Implementation Plan.

The output is a problem statement, not a design. Implementation decomposition belongs in `/flow:flow-plan #N`, which a Tech Lead runs against the issue this skill files.

## What It Does

| Step | Name | Gate |
|------|------|------|
| 1 | Conversation Gate | HARD-GATE: topic argument required |
| 2 | Role Read | Reads `.flow.json` `role` field; PM is the default voice |
| 3 | Discussion Mode | HARD-GATE: no source-code reads, no `decompose:decompose`, no sentinels, no Implementation Plan |
| 4 | Persona Dispatch | HARD-GATE: render `## SCOPE REFUSAL` verbatim, no auto-escalation |
| 5 | Wrap-up | Capture What/Why/Acceptance, validate with `--mode vanilla`, file without `--label decomposed` directly on the user's readiness signal |

1. **Step 1 — Conversation Gate:** Verifies a topic argument was provided. Without a topic the skill has no anchor for the discussion; the gate stops with usage guidance.
2. **Step 2 — Role Read:** Reads `.flow.json` for the optional `role` field. PM is the default voice for `/flow:flow-explore` regardless of role; the role only adjusts a one-line conversational note.
3. **Step 3 — Discussion Mode:** The default posture. Surfaces clarifying questions, reads prior GitHub issues via `gh issue view`, identifies acceptance criteria, iterates with the user. Forbids reading source code (that's Tech Lead territory for `/flow:flow-plan #N`), invoking `decompose:decompose`, writing FLOW-PLAN sentinel markers, and composing an `## Implementation Plan` heading. Stays here until the user explicitly requests a persona dispatch (Step 4) or signals readiness to file (Step 5).
4. **Step 4 — Persona Dispatch:** On explicit user request ("PM view?", "Tech Lead view?", "CTO view?"), summarizes the discussion as `CONVERSATION_SUMMARY` + `PROPOSED_PROBLEM_STATEMENT` and invokes the named sub-agent (`flow:pm`, `flow:tech-lead`, or `flow:cto`) via the Skill tool. Renders the agent's response verbatim. When the response is a `## SCOPE REFUSAL` block, the HARD-GATE prohibits auto-escalation, soft-re-prompting, and personal performance of the refused analysis.
5. **Step 5 — Wrap-up:** Captures the agreed problem statement (What/Why/Acceptance Criteria), runs the backwards-reasoning and include-bias scans, validates the body via `bin/flow validate-issue-body --mode vanilla`, and files the issue via `bin/flow issue` without the `decomposed` label. The user's readiness signal is the single authorization to file; on validator failure, a bounded auto-fix loop (max 5 retries) corrects the body or halts with a structured `validator_max_retries` error.

## Personas

Persona dispatch routes to one of three planning sub-agents — each with its own scope authority and escalation target.

| Persona | Skill identifier | Scope authority | Escalates to |
|---------|------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| PM | `flow:pm` | Copy, content, small changes with no new functionality or complexity | Tech Lead |
| Tech Lead | `flow:tech-lead` | Extensions of existing modules, new code following established patterns, refactors within current architecture, test additions | CTO |
| CTO | `flow:cto` | Novel architectural decisions, around-the-corner problems, outside-the-box alternatives | Terminus — no further escalation |

## Gates

- **Step 1 Conversation Gate** — `/flow:flow-explore` invoked without a topic argument stops with usage guidance. No interactive prompt; the user re-runs the command with `<topic>`.
- **Step 3 Discussion Mode HARD-GATE** — forbids source-code reads (Read on `src/` etc.), invocation of `decompose:decompose`, FLOW-PLAN sentinel markers, an `## Implementation Plan` heading, direct edits, commits, issue filing outside Step 5, inline draft issue body composition, `AskUserQuestion` self-prompts, and auto-dispatch to a planning sub-agent on inferred scope. Reading prior GitHub issues via `gh issue view` is permitted.
- **Step 4 Refusal Handling HARD-GATE** — when a sub-agent returns a `## SCOPE REFUSAL` block, the skill renders it verbatim and waits. Auto-escalation, soft-re-prompting, and personally performing the refused analysis are forbidden.
- **Step 5 Validator Gate** — the body must pass `bin/flow validate-issue-body --mode vanilla` before `bin/flow issue` runs. On validator failure, the skill applies a mechanical fix and re-runs the validator (max 5 attempts); after 5 failures the skill halts with a structured `validator_max_retries` error and the COMPLETE-FAILED banner without filing.

## Output

A vanilla GitHub issue with three top-level sections: `## What`, `## Why`, `## Acceptance Criteria`. The issue carries no `decomposed` label and no FLOW-PLAN sentinel markers. The user runs `/flow:flow-plan #N` next, which decomposes the problem statement into an implementation plan and files a linked decomposed issue ready for `/flow:flow-start`.
