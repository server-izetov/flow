# /flow-commit

**Phase:** Any

**Usage:** `/flow-commit`

Reviews all pending changes before committing. You see the full diff and proposed commit message before anything is pushed. This is the only way commits are made in the FLOW workflow.

---

## What It Does

1. Stages changes
2. Shows `git status` and `git diff --cached` in parallel
3. Proposes a commit message in the `tl;dr` format
4. Commits, pulls, and pushes via `bin/flow finalize-commit` (which enforces CI internally and re-stages tracked-file modifications after CI so in-place auto-fixes are captured in the same commit)

---

## Commit Message Format

The format is determined by the `commit_format` setting, copied from `.flow.json` into the state file by `/flow-start`. Defaults to `"full"` when no state file exists.

**Full format** (`"full"`):

```text
Full-sentence subject line (imperative verb + what + why, ends with a period.)

tl;dr

One or two sentences explaining the WHY.

- path/to/file.rb: What changed and why
- path/to/other.rb: What changed and why
```

**Title-only format** (`"title-only"`):

```text
Full-sentence subject line (imperative verb + what + why, ends with a period.)

- path/to/file.rb: What changed and why
- path/to/other.rb: What changed and why
```

Subject starts with an imperative verb — Add, Fix, Update, Remove, Refactor. Includes the business reason. Ends with a period. No prefix jargon.

---

## CI

CI is enforced inside `finalize-commit` itself — every commit path runs CI mechanically before `git commit`. When the CI sentinel is fresh (CI already passed for the current tree state), the check noops instantly. There is no separate CI step in the commit skill.

The banner is versioned (`FLOW v1.1.0`) when a `.flow-states/*.json` state file exists, plain (`Commit`) otherwise.

---

## Re-staging

After CI completes (and only when CI passed), `finalize-commit` runs `git add -u` to capture in-place modifications CI made to already-tracked files. This handles the canonical pattern where `bin/format` and `bin/lint` auto-fix tracked files in their default non-`CI=1` mode: without re-staging, the commit would record the pre-CI bytes from the index while CI tested the post-CI bytes in the working tree, and remote strict CI would fail on the unfixed bytes.

`git add -u` updates already-tracked files only — untracked artifacts (the commit-message file, scratch files, CI outputs the user has not yet `.gitignore`d) are NOT swept. The commit's scope stays bounded to what the user staged plus any in-place modifications CI made to those tracked files. A failed re-stage returns `step:"restage"` in the JSON envelope.

## Gates

- Never commits without showing the diff first
- Never uses `--no-verify`
- CI enforced inside `finalize-commit` before every commit
- Post-CI re-stage captures tracked-file modifications via `git add -u`; untracked files are not swept
