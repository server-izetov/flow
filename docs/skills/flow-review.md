# /flow-review

**Phase:** 3 — Review

**Usage:** `/flow-review` or `/flow-review --continue-step`

Six tenants assessed by four cognitively isolated agents (reviewer,
pre-mortem, adversarial, documentation) launched in parallel. The parent
session gathers context, triages findings, and fixes. All analysis comes
from agents — the parent session never reviews the diff itself.

---

## Six Tenants

1. Architecture — conventions, rules, plan alignment
2. Simplicity — unnecessary complexity, duplication
3. Maintainability — comprehension barriers for newcomers
4. Correctness — logic errors, edge cases, security
5. Test coverage — proven gaps via adversarial tests
6. Documentation — drift between docs and code behavior

---

## Steps

### Step 1 — Gather

Collect all artifacts. The diff is captured to canonical file paths
under `.flow-states/<branch>/` via `bin/flow capture-diff --branch
<branch> --base <base_branch>`, which writes both the full diff
(`full-diff.diff`) and the substantive diff (`substantive-diff.diff`,
whitespace-only changes filtered via `git diff -w`). Agents receive
the diff via file handoff (`DIFF_FILE` / `SUBSTANTIVE_DIFF_FILE`) and
Read the bytes themselves, keeping the parent skill's prompt budget
bounded as PR size grows. Step 1 also collects: plan file, CLAUDE.md,
rules files, the adversarial agent's probe path resolved by shelling
out to `bin/test --adversarial-path` (the path lives inside the
project's test tree so the language runner can discover it; halt on
exit 2 from an unconfigured stub), the `bin/flow ci --test --file`
runner command, and a narrowed list of doc paths likely affected by
the diff (derived from `git diff --name-only` via filename
heuristics — passed to the documentation agent in Step 2 so it
investigates only those paths instead of the full docs tree). Run
`tombstone-audit` to identify stale tombstones for removal in Step 4.
No analysis. If `capture-diff` reports a missing base ref
(`origin/<base>` not fetched into the worktree), Step 1 runs a single
`git fetch origin <base>` and retries once, halting rather than
launching the agents with a missing diff.

### Step 2 — Launch

Launch four agents in parallel. Reviewer is context-rich (receives
`DIFF_FILE`, plan, CLAUDE.md, rules). Pre-mortem and adversarial are
context-sparse (receive `SUBSTANTIVE_DIFF_FILE` only, investigate
independently). Documentation is context-sparse + narrowed: receives
`SUBSTANTIVE_DIFF_FILE` plus a filename-heuristic-derived list of doc
paths likely affected by the diff (Step 1 derives the list from
`git diff --name-only`), investigating only those paths so its turn
budget stays bounded on moderately-sized PRs.

All four `Agent` launches go in a single response with no intervening
tool call — no Bash, Read, Grep, Skill, or fifth `Agent` call —
between the first agent's launch and the fourth agent's return.
Each launch is recorded into `phases.flow-review.agents_returned` by
the `PreToolUse:Agent` hook (`src/hooks/agent_run_record.rs`) — the
Agent tool call itself is the evidence the agent ran — so no
per-agent record call runs between launches.

After agents return, the skill classifies each response in priority
order: read-overflow first (a context-overflow return — zero findings,
no `END-OF-FINDINGS`, an overflow marker — re-invoked once per
file-family diff slice via `capture-diff --family`, then via the
split-by-finding-type axis — a maintainability pass and a
documentation-drift pass — before the tenant is noted unavailable),
truncation second (re-invoke with a narrower partition), external
failure third
(re-invoke once, then note the failure and proceed), normal completion
otherwise. Read-overflow is evaluated before truncation because an
overflow return also lacks the `END-OF-FINDINGS` marker, and the
truncation remedy does not bound the read that overflowed. `phase-finalize` gates on
`phases.flow-review.agents_returned`: it refuses to advance with
`required_agent_not_returned` naming any required agent that was never
launched, and the recovery is to re-launch that agent.

After agents return, the skill checks each high-investigation agent
(reviewer, documentation) for the literal
`END-OF-FINDINGS` completion marker. Marker absence means the agent
was truncated by `maxTurns` exhaustion; the skill re-invokes that
agent with a narrower partition (file family for documentation,
tenant family for reviewer) and combines findings
across the multiple invocations. See
`.claude/rules/cognitive-isolation.md` "Context Budget + Truncation
Recovery".

Every retry prompt — partitioned re-invocation or re-invocation
after marker-absent detection — must scope every path it names to
the active worktree. Out-of-worktree paths in an agent's `prompt`
field would otherwise reach the sub-agent's Read tool and surface a
Claude Code permission prompt mid-autonomous-flow. The constraint is
backed by a Step 2 HARD-GATE plus two mechanical layers: the
parent-side prompt scan in `validate-pretool`'s Agent branch
(`agent_prompt_scan::validate_agent_prompt`) and the
autonomous-flow-strict response shape in `validate-worktree-paths`.
When in doubt, drop the path from the retry prompt entirely. See
`.claude/rules/cognitive-isolation.md` "Retry-prompt path-scoping
constraint".

### Step 3 — Triage

Classify each finding as **Real** (fix) or **False positive**
(dismiss with rationale). Each dismissal is recorded via
`bin/flow add-finding --outcome "dismissed"`. Shows triage summary
table. The supersession test from `.claude/rules/supersession.md`
runs before classification — code the PR has made permanently
redundant is routed to Step 4 for deletion regardless of file
location.

There is no filing path. All real findings are fixed in Step 4 —
see `.claude/rules/review-scope.md`. `bin/flow add-finding`
rejects `--outcome filed` during Review, and `bin/flow issue`
refuses to create issues while `current_phase == "flow-review"`
unless `--override-review-ban` is passed.

### Step 4 — Fix

Fix all real findings, recording each fix via `bin/flow add-finding`.
Run `bin/flow ci`, commit once via `/flow-commit`.

---

## Mode

Mode is configurable via `.flow.json` (default: manual). Two axes are
configurable independently:

- **commit** — `"auto"` or `"manual"` (default). Controls per-task review before committing.
- **continue** — `"auto"` or `"manual"` (default). Controls phase advancement.

In auto mode, findings are auto-fixed and the phase transition advances to
Complete without asking.

---

## Step Advancement

Steps advance via self-invocation: after each step completes, the skill
invokes itself with `--continue-step` as its final action. This prevents
context loss that occurs when the model treats a built-in skill return as
a conversation turn boundary. The `--continue-step` flag skips the
Announce banner and phase entry update, proceeding directly to the Resume
Check which dispatches to the next step.

On a `--continue-step` resume, the skill first recovers the worktree
directory from a session-keyed anchor (`bin/flow resume-anchor`) so it
re-anchors to the correct working directory before detecting the branch,
even when the working directory drifted between invocations.

## Gates

- Code phase must be complete before Review can start
- `bin/flow ci` must be green after all fixes
- `bin/flow ci` must be green before transitioning to Complete
- Can return to Code
- `bin/flow phase-finalize` refuses to advance with `required_agent_not_returned` when any required agent (`reviewer`, `pre-mortem`, `adversarial`, `documentation`) was never launched — `agents_returned` is written by the `PreToolUse:Agent` hook at launch time. The recovery is to re-launch the missing agent. See `docs/reference/flow-state-schema.md` "Required-Agents Gate" for the JSON contract.
