# Skill Authoring

## Simplest Approach First

When designing a skill change, start with the simplest solution that
works. If the user proposes a simple approach, do not add machinery
(resume checks, self-invocation, state counters) unless you can
explain in one sentence why the simple approach fails.

When you agree to simplify and then re-introduce the same complexity
in the next response, you are flip-flopping. Stop, re-read what you
agreed to, and follow through.

## Phase Structure

When adding a phase, audit back-navigation in all adjacent skills.
Inserting a new phase shifts numbering. Every "Go back to Code" or
"Go back to Plan" instruction in adjacent skills must reset all
intermediate phases, including the new one.

## Flat Sequential Step Numbering

All steps in a SKILL.md must use flat sequential `### Step N` headings.
Never use sub-step labels (1a, 1b, 2a–2g) or bold sub-step markers
(`**2a.`). When a group of steps shares a logical context (e.g. steps
that run under a lock), use a prose preamble before the first step in
the group instead of nesting them under a parent step.

## Permission Safety

Check the deny list before writing git commands in skills. `git
checkout` is forbidden even for file-level operations. Use `git
restore` instead. Before adding any git command to a skill's bash
blocks, verify it does not match a deny-list pattern in
`.claude/settings.json`.

Test permission changes before committing. If you cannot verify
whether a pattern is valid or will be honored, say so and propose
a testable alternative.

## Platform Constraints

Claude Code has built-in protections that cannot be overridden by
settings.json entries. `.claude/` paths are protected regardless
of `defaultMode` or allow-list patterns. The `validate-claude-paths`
PreToolUse hook (`bin/flow hook validate-claude-paths`) enforces this
for `.claude/rules/`, `.claude/skills/`, and `CLAUDE.md` during active
FLOW phases — blocking Edit/Write and redirecting to
`bin/flow write-rule`. When a permission prompt persists despite
allow-list entries, the cause is a platform constraint — not a missing
permission. Never propose adding permissions for paths that are
platform-protected.

### Directory creation for new skill paths

When a plan introduces a new skill, rule, or agent file that
requires a parent directory that does not yet exist, route the
directory creation through `bin/flow write-rule` rather than
running a bare `mkdir` against the `.claude/` path. The platform
constraint above extends to `mkdir` from a bash block: Claude
Code refuses the directory-creation tool call under `.claude/`
regardless of settings.json, so a `mkdir .claude/skills/<new>/`
line in any skill or agent surfaces a permission prompt mid-flow
— exactly the system-initiated-prompts class
`.claude/rules/autonomous-phase-discipline.md` forbids.

`bin/flow write-rule` (`src/write_rule.rs`) calls
`fs::create_dir_all(parent)` from inside the Rust subprocess
before its `fs::write`, so writing the new file routes the
directory creation through the sanctioned tool surface. The
subprocess has filesystem authority the Bash tool does not, and
the call works whether the parent existed or not. No prior
`mkdir` is needed; the write-rule invocation alone creates every
missing ancestor.

`tests/skill_contracts.rs::skills_no_mkdir_on_claude_paths` is
the corpus scanner that locks this invariant in: every fenced
bash block under `skills/`, `.claude/skills/`, and `agents/` is
scanned for `mkdir(\s+-[a-z]+)?\s+[^\s]*\.claude/` and a single
match fails CI.

## Commit Skill Internals

Never skip `git add -A` in flow:commit Step 1. The Code phase
task review shows diffs via `git diff HEAD`, which displays
unstaged changes without staging them. The commit skill must
always run `git add -A` before `git diff --cached`.

The commit message lives at `<commit_cwd>/.flow-commit-msg` —
derived by `finalize-commit` from its commit cwd, not from a
caller-supplied argument. The path is gitignored via
`EXCLUDE_ENTRIES`, so `git add -A` never picks the file up, and
`finalize-commit` deletes it on every exit so a stale file cannot
pre-exist a retry — there is no need for a `git restore --staged`
step.

Parent phases that invoke `/flow:flow-commit` must never write
the commit-msg file themselves. The commit skill owns the file
end to end: it writes `.flow-commit-msg` at the worktree root in
Round 5 with a plain Write tool call (no write-rule route), and
`finalize-commit` reads and deletes it after the git commit
succeeds.

## Sub-Agent Safety

Never use `general-purpose` sub-agents in skills — they ignore
tool restriction rules in their prompts. Use custom plugin
sub-agents with the global `PreToolUse` hook for system-level
enforcement. The hook (`bin/flow hook validate-pretool`) is
registered in `hooks/hooks.json` and blocks compound commands,
command substitution (quote-aware — operators inside single- or
double-quoted arguments pass through), shell redirection, and
`general-purpose` Agent calls during active FLOW phases with
exit code 2, feeding helpful error messages back to the
sub-agent so it adapts.

Never use `bypassPermissions` mode on sub-agents. Permission deny
lists exist to prevent destructive operations. Always use the
default mode. If a sub-agent needs a denied permission, surface it
to the user.

## Unexpected Test Failures

When bin/ci reveals an unexpected conflicting test, report before
fixing. Name the conflicting test, explain why it conflicts, and
describe the fix. Do not silently expand the scope.

## Plan Task Ordering

Every plan must include test tasks — even for pure-markdown skills,
add contract tests in `tests/skill_contracts.rs`. TDD means the test
task comes before the implementation task it validates.

When a plan removes a named feature from any source file — SKILL.md
content, Rust functions, Rust structs or enums, `.claude/rules/`
files, config axes, external dependencies — include a tombstone test <!-- tombstone-checklist: not-a-tombstone -->
task before the removal tasks. The tombstone test asserts the
removed identifier does NOT appear in the modified files. This
applies equally to skill removals and Rust source removals — the
`.claude/rules/tombstone-tests.md` "When to Add" criterion is <!-- tombstone-checklist: not-a-tombstone -->
universal and covers every intentional removal of a named feature,
not just skill-scoped ones. Without a tombstone, the removal has no
CI-visible protection.

## Decompose Completeness

When the user makes a material correction to the approach after the
initial decompose run, re-run decompose with the complete corrected
understanding before writing the plan. A decompose based on partial
understanding produces a plan that looks correct but was never
validated against the full design. Do not patch the plan manually —
the decompose must see the complete algorithm.

## Negative-Assertion Test Compatibility

When writing a SKILL.md instruction that prohibits a specific string
(e.g. "do not use --comment"), phrase the prohibition without including
the literal prohibited string. A contract test that scans the entire
SKILL.md content would otherwise be tripped by the prohibition text
itself. Use paraphrased instructions such as "invoke with no flags or
arguments" instead of "do not pass the --comment flag."

## Codebase-Wide Renames

When planning a rename of phase names, skill names, or commands:
always audit CLAUDE.md explicitly — it is hand-maintained and
frequently contains command references, phase name prose, and
convention entries that don't surface in automated grep-based scope
analysis. Missed CLAUDE.md references cause user-visible doc drift.

## Skill Ordering Audit

When reordering skill listings (presets, questions, tables), audit
every location where skill order is encoded — including programmatic
maps like `AUTO_SKILLS` in Rust source, not just Markdown content in
SKILL.md files. Rust `IndexMap` key order is preserved and written to
state files and `.flow.json`, making it load-bearing.

## Cleanup Script Step Ordering

When adding a new step to `src/cleanup.rs` that operates on files
inside the worktree, place it BEFORE the worktree removal step.
The `git worktree remove` call deletes the entire directory tree —
any step that reads or removes worktree-internal files must precede
it or the target path will not exist.

Files under `.flow-states/` at the project root are NOT inside the
worktree — they live in the main repo's directory tree and persist
across worktree removal. Cleanup steps that operate on those files
may be placed after the worktree removal step without risk. The
distinguishing test is "does this step's target path pass through
`.worktrees/<branch>/`?" If yes, it must precede `git worktree
remove`. If no, placement is free.

Similarly, any SKILL.md command that reads `.flow-states/` files
(state file, log, CI sentinel) must be placed in a numbered step
BEFORE the cleanup step. The Done section runs after cleanup — by
that point, `.flow-states/<branch>/state.json` has been deleted and any
command that reads it will fail.

## Cd-Before-bin/flow Carve-Out for Destructive Worktree Operations

Most `bin/flow` subcommands resolve the project root internally and
do not require the caller to `cd` anywhere — every phase skill's
Hard Rules section forbids `cd` before invoking `bin/flow`.

The exception is `bin/flow complete-finalize`. The command removes
the worktree as part of cleanup. When the caller's shell sits inside
the worktree at invocation time, a successful removal leaves the
shell in a deleted directory. The skill that invokes
`complete-finalize` must therefore `cd <project_root>` before the
invocation. The subcommand also self-gates: it returns
`{"status":"error","reason":"cwd_inside_worktree"}` when its
canonicalized cwd equals or sits beneath the canonicalized
`--worktree`.

This carve-out applies only to subcommands whose execution path
removes the caller's cwd. New subcommands that only mutate state
or read files inherit the default rule (no `cd` before
`bin/flow`).

## Numbered Lists With Fenced Code Blocks

Never use numbered lists (1. 2. 3.) when fenced code blocks appear
between items. Markdown linters treat each code block as a list
interruption, resetting the expected prefix. Use bold paragraph
headers (**Step name.**) instead of numbered items when steps
contain code blocks.

## Fenced Code Blocks Before Closing Tags

When a bash block ends immediately before a closing XML-like tag
(`</SOFT-GATE>`, `</HARD-GATE>`), add a blank line between the
closing ` ``` ` and the tag. Markdown lint rules require a blank line
after every fenced code block, including when the next line is a
closing tag rather than prose.

## Decision Point Gates

Every user decision point in every skill — phase or utility — must be
wrapped in `<HARD-GATE>` tags with explicit enforcement language. Prose
instructions like "ask the user" or "use AskUserQuestion" are
insufficient on their own. Without the HARD-GATE wrapper, Claude treats
approval prompts as suggestions that can be bypassed when the answer
seems obvious — especially after extended discussion where a solution
has already been explored.

The HARD-GATE must prohibit all action without explicit user approval:
proceeding to the next step, proposing direct edits, committing changes,
or taking any action outside the active skill flow.

## Hard Rules Consistency

When adding a flag that bypasses a HARD-GATE (e.g. `--auto`), audit
the skill's Hard Rules section for absolute prohibitions that the
bypass contradicts. A Hard Rule saying "Never do X" while a HARD-GATE
says "If --auto, do X" creates conflicting instructions. Update the
Hard Rule with a carve-out for the new flag.

## Safe Defaults for Subjective Classification

When a skill asks the model to classify conversation content (e.g.,
"is this output implementation-focused?"), include an explicit
tiebreaker for ambiguous cases. The safe default is always the
conservative action — the one that produces correct behavior even
if the classification is wrong.

## Contract Test Atomicity in Plan Dependencies

When a plan removes content that a contract test asserts exists, and a
later task re-adds it at a different location, the plan must mark those
tasks as atomically dependent — they must be in the same commit. Otherwise
CI fails in the intermediate state when the content is absent.

Before finalizing the dependency graph, check every removal task against
`tests/skill_contracts.rs` assertions. If any assertion validates the
presence of the removed content, pair the removal with the re-addition
task.

## State-Dependent Gate Ordering in Multi-Step Skills

When a SKILL.md step invokes a gate command (`bin/flow check-phase`,
`bin/flow <anything that reads state>`), the gate has an implicit
precondition: every state field the gate reads must already be
written by a prior step. Instruction-level gates do not assert this
precondition — they run the command, parse the output, and branch on
the result. If the field was never set, the gate sees an empty value
and either passes trivially or errors in a way the skill does not
anticipate.

**When authoring the plan.** When a plan task adds a gate command
to a SKILL.md step, the plan's Risks section must enumerate (a)
every state field the gate reads, and (b) every prior step that
must write that field. The Code phase task description must state
the textual order explicitly: "After `set-timestamp --set <field>`,
before any gate that reads `<field>`."

**Contract test discipline.** Every state-dependent gate needs a
contract test in `tests/skill_contracts.rs` that asserts BOTH
orderings hold in the committed SKILL.md:

1. **Textual ordering.** The `set-timestamp --set <field>` invocation
   must appear in the SKILL.md content BEFORE the gate command that
   reads `<field>`.
2. **Adjacency check.** No numbered `### Step` heading may sit
   between the state mutation and the gate. An intermediate step
   could fail, halting the skill between "state written" and "gate
   runs" — the invariant the test locks in is that both actions land
   inside the same step so a failure cannot separate them.

A textual-only ordering test catches regression A (someone moves the
gate above the state mutation). The adjacency check catches regression
B (someone inserts a new step in the middle).

**How to apply.** When adding a gate command to a SKILL.md, search the
file for every `set-timestamp --set` call that writes a field the gate
reads, verify textual and adjacent ordering, and write the contract
test in the same commit as the gate.

## Destination Renumbering

When renumbering destinations or steps within a SKILL.md, grep for the
old numbers throughout the entire file before marking the change complete.
Preamble summary lines (e.g. "Use `<worktree_path>` for destinations 2
and 4") are easy to miss because they sit far from the destination table
they reference.

Also audit spelled-out step counts in prose sections (e.g. "six review
steps" buried inside a paragraph). These do not follow the `Step N`
pattern and are invisible to number-based grep. Search for the old
count as a word ("six", "three", etc.) in addition to as a digit.

Also audit skip/jump targets — instructions like "Skip directly to
Step 8 (cleanup)" that reference steps by number. When inserting a new
step, these targets must be reconsidered for intent, not just
mechanically incremented.

When a step is moved (not added), range boundaries need special
attention. "Steps 2–11" does not become "Steps 2–12" just because every
reference was mechanically incremented — the total step count is
unchanged if a step moved from one position to another. After all edits,
verify the range endpoint by counting `### Step N` headings in the file.

## Value Replacements in Prose

When replacing a value in code (e.g. swapping one entry in a list for
another), grep the entire SKILL.md for the old value — not just the
lines the plan identifies. Prose descriptions of what the code does
(e.g. Step 4 describing what a setup script writes) echo the code's
values and are easy to miss when the plan only lists code locations.

## Verify Script Behavior Claims in Issues

When an issue body asserts specific script behavior (e.g. "field X is
populated after Step Y"), verify the assertion by reading the script
source before writing the implementation. Issue authors — including
Claude in prior sessions — can be wrong about what a script does
internally. A single grep of the script for the relevant field or
function catches false assumptions before they become bugs in the
implementation.

## Verify Command References in Issues

When an issue body or plan references a `/flow:<skill-name>` command as
a user directive, verify `skills/<skill-name>/` exists in the repo
before writing the implementation. Prior-session issue authors —
including Claude — can reference skills that have since been removed.
A single glob for the skill directory catches stale references before
they become error messages that direct users to non-existent commands.

## Verify Test Function References in Issues

When an issue body or pre-decomposed plan references specific test
functions, helper functions, or test fixtures by name —
`tests/<file>.rs::<function_name>`, "the existing
`parse_settings_allow_list` helper", "extract the category list from
the test fixture" — verify the named entity exists in the current
codebase before writing the implementation via Grep. Issue authors —
including Claude in prior sessions — can name test functions that
were renamed, never created, or carried forward from a different
codebase generation. Building a plan task on a non-existent fixture
produces an unfounded scope-drop deviation in Code phase that
pre-Code verification could have prevented.

The cheapest signal: for every backtick-quoted test or function
identifier in the issue body or `## Implementation Plan` section,
run a single Grep over `tests/` (or the relevant `src/` directory)
to confirm the identifier appears as a definition (e.g.
`fn <name>(`), not just as a prose reference.

## Config Chain Integrity

The autonomy config chain is: prime presets → `.flow.json` → state file → skill reads.
`/flow-prime` writes defaults to `.flow.json`. The user customizes `.flow.json`.
`/flow-start` copies settings (`skills`) from `.flow.json` into
the state file. Phase skills read only from the state file — never `.flow.json`
(which lives at the project root and is inaccessible from worktrees).
When a phase skill's config is missing at runtime, the fix is always at the source
(add the skill to the prime presets in `flow-prime/SKILL.md`), never at the consumer
(adding `.flow.json` fallback reads to the skill). Every skill in `CONFIGURABLE_SKILLS`
(`tests/skill_contracts.rs`) must have an entry in all 4 prime presets — CI enforces this.

## Mid-Phase Self-Invocation

When a phase skill invokes built-in skills (Skill tool) mid-phase and
must continue after the built-in skill returns, use self-invocation —
not HARD-GATEs. HARD-GATEs are instructional Markdown that the model
ignores at Skill tool turn boundaries. The correct pattern: after each
sub-step completes, invoke the skill itself as the FINAL action with
a `--continue-step` flag. The skill's Resume Check reads a step counter
from the state file and dispatches to the next sub-step on re-entry.

## Target Project Mindset

Every bash block, subprocess call, and file path in a plugin skill
or Rust module runs in a target project, not this repo. Before
adding any command, ask: "Does this work in a fresh project that has
no `bin/flow` and only the four `bin/{format,lint,build,test}` stubs
the user installed via prime?" Integration tests for Rust modules
that run in target projects should simulate a target project layout
(git repo with non-bash `bin/*` scripts, no `bin/flow`) using
`create_git_repo_with_remote()` and manual fixture setup.

## Plugin User Reachability

Every new feature — not just skill bash blocks — must have a clear
answer to: "How does a plugin user in a target project access this?"
before implementation begins. If the answer is unclear, the feature
will ship unreachable.

There are exactly three valid access paths for plugin users:

1. **Skill** — a slash command (`/flow:flow-xxx`) the user invokes
2. **Hook** — auto-triggered by Claude Code events (SessionStart,
   PreToolUse, etc.)
3. **Global launcher** — a `flow <subcommand>` routed through
   `bin/flow`

If a feature does not fit one of these three paths, it is unreachable
from a target project and must not proceed past planning without a
design that makes it reachable.

## Plugin Root for bin/flow

`bin/flow` invocations in skill bash blocks resolve differently
depending on where the skill lives — plugin-marketplace skills run
in target projects, project-local maintainer skills run only in the
FLOW repo. Each case has its own canonical form:

- **Plugin-marketplace skills under `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`** —
  MUST use the plugin root prefix to resolve `bin/flow` in target
  projects, where the user's cwd is not the FLOW repo. The canonical
  form is:

  ```bash
  ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow
  ```

  This half is enforced by runtime behavior in target projects (a
  permission prompt or "command not found" surfaces the first time
  a violation runs) rather than by a corpus contract test, so the
  mechanical asymmetry between the two halves is intentional.
- **Project-local skills at `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`**
  (direct-child SKILL.md only — nested `.claude/skills/<group>/`
  layouts are not in scope) — MUST use bare `bin/flow`. These
  skills run only in the FLOW repo where cwd resolves bare
  `bin/flow` directly. The plugin root prefix triggers Claude
  Code's "Contains expansion" permission prompt with no benefit.
  Documentation comments and prose-as-anti-example citations of
  the prefix belong in `.claude/rules/skill-authoring.md` (this
  file), not in any project-local SKILL.md — the scanner flags
  every occurrence of the brace-expansion form in those files
  regardless of fence shape or surrounding context.

The project-local case is enforced mechanically by
`tests/skill_contracts.rs::no_claude_skills_use_plugin_root_expansion`,
which scans every direct-child `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` for
any occurrence of the brace-expansion form anywhere in the file
content (not just inside ` ```bash ` fences) — broadening the match
ensures sibling fence shapes (` ```sh `, ` ```shell `, ` ~~~bash `,
indented blocks) and shell-composition bypasses (concatenation
variants like adjacent empty quotes after the prefix) cannot route
around the gate.

The wider prose corpus is enforced mechanically by
`tests/skill_contracts.rs::no_prose_uses_plugin_root_expansion`,
which walks `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/rules/*.md`, every
plugin-marketplace `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, `agents/*.md`,
`docs/**/*.md`, and `src/**/*.rs`. The Markdown walker is
fence-aware so syntactic uses inside bash fences are preserved;
the Rust walker checks every line because doc-comment uses of the
brace-form trip the same expansion heuristic when the documented
identifier is copied into runtime argument values. Bare-identifier
`CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` env-var lookups in `src/utils.rs` and
`src/start_init.rs` are out of scope by content — the bare
identifier (no `${}`) does not trigger the heuristic.

## Worktree bin/flow for Repo-Modifying Commands

When running repo-modifying bin/flow subcommands (e.g. bump-version) during
the Code phase in a worktree, use the worktree's own bin/flow — not the
cached plugin's `bin/flow` reached via the plugin root prefix. These scripts
resolve file paths relative to __file__, so the cached plugin writes to the
cache directory. FLOW state commands (phase-transition, set-timestamp, log,
ci) use project_root() and work from either path.

## Worktree Path for Repo-Tracked Files

When a skill instruction tells Claude to check for or read a
repo-tracked file (`bin/test`, `bin/ci`, source files, `CLAUDE.md`,
`.claude/rules/`), the instruction must say "current working
directory" or omit the path — never "project root."

In a linked worktree, `git worktree list --porcelain` returns the
main repo as the first entry (the "project root"). Repo-tracked
files live in the worktree, not the main repo. Directing Claude to
"the project root" sends it to the wrong copy, and the
`validate-worktree-paths` hook blocks the call.

Project root is correct only for shared paths that live outside
the worktree: `.flow-states/`, `.flow-issue-body`, and other
branch-scoped artifacts in the main repo directory.

CI enforces this via
`skills_no_repo_tracked_files_at_project_root`.

## Last-Line JSON Parsing for Child-Inheriting Scripts

When a Rust module runs a child process without capturing its stdout
(e.g. `Command::new(...).status()` without `stdout(Stdio::piped())`),
the child's output goes to the same stdout as the module's JSON.
SKILL.md instructions that parse this module's output must say "parse
the last line" — not "parse the JSON output."

## Truncation Detection Marker Contracts

When a skill checks agent output for expected structural markers
(e.g. truncation detection in flow-learn), those marker strings
are implicit contracts with the agent's Output Format section. If
the agent's output format changes, the skill's detection markers
must be updated in the same commit. Add a comment in the skill
near the marker list citing the source agent file and section.

## Delegation Path Tests Need No Migration

When a plan migrates logic from one implementation to another but
keeps the same public entry point (e.g. a bash shim that now
delegates to a new implementation), check whether existing tests
that drive the entry point automatically cover the new path before
planning a test migration task.

Why: integration tests that invoke the entry point (e.g. `bash
SCRIPT`) are implementation-agnostic — they exercise whatever code
the entry point ultimately runs. When the entry point delegates to a
new implementation, the existing tests become the new
implementation's integration tests automatically. Planning a "port
the tests" task in this case wastes plan effort and produces no
artifact.

How to apply: before adding a test-migration task, verify whether
existing tests at the entry-point level already cover the new
delegation path. If yes, replace the migration task with a single
verification task (run the existing tests and confirm they pass
against the new implementation).

## Placeholder Consistency in Parameterized Tables

When a SKILL.md includes a table that parameterizes behavior (paths,
commands, configuration) across multiple rows, every row must use the
same placeholder names for equivalent columns. If one row uses
`<temp_test_file>` in a command column, all rows that include a
command must use the same placeholder — not `<path>` or other aliases.

Why: placeholder names are contracts with downstream consumers (agents,
permission tests, placeholder substitution in `tests/permissions.rs`).
Inconsistent naming means only one variant gets tested and the others
silently substitute wrong values or skip validation entirely.

## Placeholder Resolution Must Match Runtime Paths

When a skill instruction or agent prompt uses a placeholder to name a
file path (e.g. `<temp_test_file>`), the placeholder's resolved value
must be the EXACT path the code eventually writes, reads, or removes
— not a logical abstraction, not a prefix, not a base name.

### Why this matters

A placeholder that represents a conceptual file (`<temp_test_file>` =
`.flow-states/<branch>/adversarial_test` without extension) while the
producing code actually writes a concrete file with an additional
suffix (`.flow-states/<branch>/adversarial_test.rs`) creates a silent
cleanup gap: `rm <temp_test_file>` targets a path that never exists,
succeeds with no effect, and the real file orphans.

### How to apply

1. **Trace the placeholder to every reader and writer.** Grep the
   skill and its sub-agents for every occurrence of the placeholder.
   Every producer (Write, cp, touch) and every consumer (rm, Read,
   test, cat) must use paths that resolve to the same physical file.
2. **If the extension is chosen at runtime**, the placeholder that
   appears in cleanup instructions must either (a) carry the
   extension too (so the cleanup matches exactly what was written),
   (b) use a glob pattern that matches the runtime variants, or
   (c) defer cleanup to a phase that can enumerate matches by
   prefix.
3. **Abstractions are for documentation, not for cleanup commands.**
   It is fine to describe a file conceptually in prose, but the
   actual `rm`, `Write`, or `Read` call must use a path that resolves
   to the real bytes on disk.
4. **Pre-Code verification.** When a plan adds or modifies a skill
   that writes a temp file and cleans it up later, grep both the
   writer's and cleaner's references to the placeholder and confirm
   the resolved path matches byte-for-byte.

## Purpose Preamble for Behavioral Sections

Every new behavioral subsection in a SKILL.md (a subsection with
decision logic, conditional branches, or tool invocations) must open
with a 2-3 sentence preamble explaining why the step exists and what
problem it solves. The preamble answers "Why does this step exist?"
before the mechanics of "How does it work?"

Without the preamble, a newcomer reading the skill sees the mechanics
but cannot judge whether the step is still relevant after a refactor.
The preamble makes the intent explicit so future sessions can evaluate
whether the step still serves its purpose.
