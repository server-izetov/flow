# Permission Patterns

## Specificity Over Breadth

Use the narrowest pattern that serves the consumer. When the
consumer needs a known file extension, use that extension — never
replace it with a wildcard.

- `Read(//tmp/*.md)` — correct when the consumer reads markdown
- `Read(//tmp/*)` — too broad; covers every file type in `/tmp/`

Directory-level wildcards are acceptable only when every file in
the directory is a valid target. `Read(~/.claude/rules/*)` is fine
because all files in that directory are rules.

## Consumer Traceability

Every allow-list pattern must have a known consumer — a specific
skill, plugin, hook, or tool that needs the permission. If you
cannot name the consumer, do not add the pattern.

Before proposing a new pattern, answer: "Which skill or tool
invokes this command or reads this path?" If the answer is vague
("something might need it"), the pattern is speculative and should
not be added.

## Adding Patterns

When adding a new allow-list pattern, name the consumer in the
commit message or PR description so the audit trail is preserved.

Example commit message:

```text
Add Read(//tmp/*.diff) permission for review plugin
```

This makes the allow list auditable — any pattern can be traced
back to why it was added and what breaks if it is removed.

## Symmetric R+W /tmp/ Extension Policy

`UNIVERSAL_ALLOW` covers a closed set of `/tmp/` extensions —
`.txt`, `.diff`, `.patch`, `.md`, `.json`, `.jsonl` — and grants
Read AND Write for the same extension set symmetrically. Anything
the model can Read under `/tmp/` it can also Write; extensions
outside the set continue to require an explicit permission prompt
by design (per the "Specificity Over Breadth" subsection above, a
broader `*` pattern would defeat per-extension granularity). The
symmetric shape is intentional: legitimate user-shared artifacts
(diffs, patches, JSON dumps, transcript-shaped records) flow in
both directions, and asymmetric coverage would surface a prompt
mid-autonomous-flow the moment a Read-only path needed to be
written. When a model needs a `/tmp/` extension outside the set,
prefer `.flow-states/<branch>/` — the branch-scoped scratch
surface that does not race between concurrent flows. See
`.claude/rules/no-placeholder-anchors.md` for the broader
concurrency rationale that forbids placeholder-file-then-redirect
anchoring regardless of destination.

## Plan-Phase Enumeration of Skill-Added Bash Commands

When a plan modifies a skill (`skills/**/SKILL.md` or
`.claude/skills/**/SKILL.md`) to invoke a new bash command, the
plan's Tasks section MUST enumerate the command and confirm one of:

1. The command's first whitespace-separated token already matches
   an existing entry in `UNIVERSAL_ALLOW`
   (`src/prime_check.rs::UNIVERSAL_ALLOW`), so no allow-list change
   is needed.
2. The plan adds the matching `Bash(<pattern>)` entry to BOTH
   `UNIVERSAL_ALLOW` (the canonical Rust source) and
   `skills/flow-prime/SKILL.md` (the prime permissions JSON block —
   the source `tests/permissions.rs::all_bash_commands_have_permission_coverage`
   reads at test time).

Forgetting either side breaks `bin/flow ci`: the contract test in
`tests/permissions.rs` walks every SKILL.md bash block, extracts the
command, and asserts it matches at least one allow-list entry. A
new skill bash command without a matching entry fails CI in Code
phase.

### What counts as a new bash command

A bash block in a SKILL.md introduces a "new" command when its
first token (the program name, modulo the plugin root prefix)
is not already covered by an existing `UNIVERSAL_ALLOW`
entry. Examples:

- A skill that adds `bin/test --adversarial-path` introduces a new
  command — `Bash(bin/test --adversarial-path)` is the matching
  entry.
- A skill that adds `bin/flow custom-subcmd` (resolved via the
  plugin root prefix) is covered by the existing
  `Bash(*bin/flow *)` entry — no permission change needed.
- A skill that adds `gh release upload <tag> <file>` likely needs
  a new `Bash(gh release upload *)` entry.

### How to apply

**Plan phase.** For every plan task that modifies a SKILL.md to
add a bash block, the task description must include a "Permission
coverage" subsection naming:

1. The command's first token.
2. The matching existing `UNIVERSAL_ALLOW` entry, OR the new
   `Bash(<pattern>)` entry the plan will add to both
   `src/prime_check.rs::UNIVERSAL_ALLOW` and
   `skills/flow-prime/SKILL.md`.
3. An acknowledgement that adding to `UNIVERSAL_ALLOW` will bump
   `compute_config_hash`, requiring a `CURRENT_CONFIG_HASH` update
   in `tests/prime_check.rs::compute_config_hash_uses_python_default_formatter`.

**Code phase.** When implementing the SKILL.md change, the same
commit must include the matching allow-list addition + the
`CURRENT_CONFIG_HASH` bump.

**Review phase.** The reviewer agent cross-checks every new
SKILL.md bash command in the diff against the diff's allow-list
changes. A SKILL.md bash command without a matching allow-list
entry is a Real finding fixed in Step 4.

## bin/flow Dispatch First

Before adding any `Bash(*bin/<script>)` wildcard entry to
`UNIVERSAL_ALLOW`, answer: "Can this script be routed through
`bin/flow`?" The model's canonical entry into the project's script
surface is `bin/flow`, and the single permission entry
`Bash(*bin/flow *)` covers every subcommand under it. A new
wildcard `bin/*` allow entry expands the model's reachable command
surface without going through the dispatcher's discoverability
contract, so the default answer is to add a `bin/flow <subcommand>`
Rust arm and reuse the existing allow entry.

### Script body vs. dispatch

The dispatch question is orthogonal to the script-body language.
A `bin/flow <subcommand>` Rust arm can be a thin shim that exec's
an existing shell script — the bash body is preserved, only the
invocation path changes. `src/reset.rs` is the reference: it exec's
`bin/reset` (resolved via the plugin root prefix) from inside a
`Commands::Reset` match arm so callers reach the script through
the `bin/flow` dispatcher. Porting the script body to Rust is a
separate decision made on Rust-win merits, not a prerequisite for
routing through `bin/flow`.

### When bin/flow cannot reach

Target-project-owned discovery hooks are the closed set of
exceptions, distinguished structurally: they appear in
`UNIVERSAL_ALLOW` as exact-form (non-wildcard) entries because the
cwd-relative bare path is the only resolvable form. Examples:
`Bash(bin/test --adversarial-path)` (Review's adversarial agent
reaches the project's own `bin/test` to discover the canonical
probe path) and `Bash(bin/dependencies)` (Complete's toolchain
refresh invokes the project's own `bin/dependencies`). Routing
either through `bin/flow` would put the script body inside the
FLOW plugin rather than the target project's repo, which is the
opposite of what these hooks need to do.

### Mechanical enforcement

`tests/permissions.rs::universal_allow_wildcard_bin_entries_are_whitelisted`
asserts every wildcard entry in `UNIVERSAL_ALLOW` whose pattern
contains `bin/` matches an explicit whitelist
(`ALLOWED_WILDCARD_BIN_ENTRIES`). The whitelist's intent is to
force a new wildcard `bin/*` entry to clear the dispatch-first
question explicitly: extending the whitelist requires naming a
context in which `bin/flow` genuinely cannot dispatch. The
exact-form discovery-hook entries above are exempt by structure
(no `*` in the pattern), so they do not require whitelist
extension.

### How to apply

**Plan phase.** When a plan proposes a new model-invoked script,
decide between plugin-owned (route through `bin/flow` and reuse
the existing `Bash(*bin/flow *)` allow entry) and
target-project-owned (add an exact-form `Bash(bin/<script>)` entry
for a discovery hook the target project must own). Adding a
wildcard `bin/*` entry to the whitelist is reserved for the rare
case neither pattern fits.

**Review phase.** The reviewer agent flags any diff that adds a
wildcard `bin/*` entry to `UNIVERSAL_ALLOW` without a matching
extension of `ALLOWED_WILDCARD_BIN_ENTRIES` AND a justification in
the plan or commit message naming why `bin/flow` cannot dispatch
the call.

## Plan-Phase Verification of FLOW_DENY Pattern Additions

When a plan adds entries to `FLOW_DENY` (`src/prime_check.rs`),
the patterns are glob-shaped strings that `permission_to_regex`
converts into anchored regular expressions: `Bash(find * -exec *)`
becomes `^find .* \-exec .*$`. The literal whitespace between
glob stars is REQUIRED in the matched input — `*` matches "zero
or more characters" but it does NOT swallow its surrounding
literal-space anchors. A pattern with a path slot like
`Bash(find * -exec *)` therefore silently passes any invocation
that omits the path token (`find -exec rm \;`), because the
regex demands `find␣<chars>␣-exec␣<chars>` and the input lacks
the second space.

The Plan phase must enumerate bypass variants before adding the
patterns to `FLOW_DENY`. For every proposed pattern:

1. **Mentally compile.** Apply `permission_to_regex` by hand:
   escape regex metacharacters, replace `\*` with `.*`, anchor
   with `^...$`. Write the regex on the plan task description.
2. **Enumerate invocation shapes.** For the command being
   denied, list every grammatically valid form:
   - Required-argument forms (`find . -exec rm \;`)
   - Optional-argument forms (`find -exec rm \;` — `find`
     defaults the path to `.`)
   - Flag-only forms (`find -delete` — recursive deletion of
     cwd)
   - Multi-arg forms (`find . -name x -delete -print`)
   - Whitespace variants (multiple spaces, tabs)
3. **Match each shape against the regex.** For every shape that
   the regex DOES NOT match, the pattern is incomplete. Either
   add additional patterns to cover the gap, or change the
   pattern shape (`*X` and `X*` allow the literal-space anchor
   to vanish into the wildcard).
4. **Decide pattern strategy.** When the bypass surface is wide
   enough that a regex pattern cannot cover every shape without
   over-matching, prefer a structural check in
   `src/hooks/validate_pretool.rs` that tokenizes the command
   and rejects destructive flags by name. Reference: Layer 4 in
   `validate-pretool` rejects `find` with `-exec` /
   `-execdir` / `-ok` / `-okdir` / `-delete` regardless of
   path arity, replacing the buggy regex-pattern-driven approach
   that required a non-empty path slot.

A plan that proposes new `FLOW_DENY` regex patterns without this
enumeration is incomplete. Review's adversarial agent will
catch the bypass — but at the cost of a full review cycle, a
pattern revert, and a structural-layer rewrite that the Plan
phase could have produced directly.

## Removing a Settings-Based Guard: Upgrade-Window Discipline

`FLOW_DENY` and `UNIVERSAL_ALLOW` reach target projects through
`/flow:flow-prime` writing to `.claude/settings.json`. The
`compute_config_hash` invariant forces re-prime on version
upgrade, but the upgrade is GATED by the user running a FLOW
phase that calls `prime-check`. Until that runs, the project
sits with stale settings — old allow list, old deny list — even
though the upgraded plugin code is loaded.

When a Plan proposes REMOVING a settings-driven guard (deleting
a Layer that read deny patterns, removing a hardcoded check that
the new design plans to replace via FLOW_DENY entries, etc.),
the Plan must enumerate the upgrade-window gap explicitly:

1. **Identify the protection being removed.** Name the layer,
   gate, or hook the Plan deletes. Identify the input shape it
   was protecting against.
2. **Identify the replacement.** What new mechanism takes over?
   `FLOW_DENY` entries? `UNIVERSAL_ALLOW` revisions? A different
   structural check?
3. **Map the dependency on settings.json.** Does the
   replacement require `settings.json` to be re-primed? If yes,
   the upgrade window is open: any session running with the
   upgraded plugin and the OLD `settings.json` has neither the
   removed protection nor the replacement.
4. **Decide the closure strategy.** Three options, in order of
   preference:
   - **Structural backup.** Add a hardcoded check in
     `src/hooks/validate_pretool.rs` (or equivalent) that does
     not depend on settings.json. The check fires regardless of
     the user's prime state. Reference: Layer 4's tokenized
     find-safety check is the canonical example.
   - **Forced re-prime.** Bump `config_hash` so the next session
     start blocks until the user re-primes. The Plan must verify
     that `prime_check` returns `error` on hash mismatch (not
     `auto_upgraded`) so the user actually re-primes.
   - **Accept the gap.** Document in the plan's Risks section
     that pre-reprime sessions are exposed, name the threat
     model the gap accepts, and explain why a structural backup
     would be over-engineering.

A plan that removes a settings-based guard without naming all
four (protection, replacement, settings dependency, closure
strategy) is incomplete. Review's pre-mortem agent will
catch the gap as a security regression — but at the cost of a
review cycle that the Plan phase could have prevented.

## Never Remove Without Explicit Ask

When editing `.claude/settings.json`, only add entries — never
remove existing permission entries unless the user explicitly asks.
An entry may serve purposes the current task does not know about.

When an entry needs to be repositioned, add first in the new
location, then remove the duplicate — and explain the two-step
approach before starting.

### Prime-Time Active Deny Removal Carve-Out

`/flow:flow-prime` runs `merge_settings` during initial setup and
re-prime. The merge enforces an "allow always wins" invariant:
when an entry's exact string appears in BOTH the existing allow
list AND the existing deny list, the deny entry is removed
during the merge. The same exact-string match also blocks FLOW's
own `FLOW_DENY` entries from being appended when the user has
already opted into the same permission via allow.

This is the one sanctioned exception to "never remove without
explicit ask" — the user implicitly asks for it by running
`/flow:flow-prime`, and the action targets only entries the user
themselves placed in conflicting lists. The merge does not
remove deny entries that have no allow-list counterpart, and
`UNIVERSAL_ALLOW` / `FLOW_DENY` are validated against each other
by the `no_allow_deny_overlap_in_plugin_permissions` test.

The match is exact-string only. A user with `Bash(git push)` in
their deny list and `Bash(git *)` (broader pattern) in their
allow list keeps the deny — subsumption-based removal is out of
scope. See `src/prime_setup.rs::merge_settings_with`.

## Never Edit Permissions Mid-Flow

Never modify `.claude/settings.json` inside a worktree during an
active FLOW phase. Claude Code enforces permission changes
immediately — removing or narrowing a pattern breaks tools the
current task still needs, causing permission prompts or hook
blocks mid-session.

Permission lockdown changes belong in `src/prime_check.rs`
(UNIVERSAL_ALLOW, FLOW_DENY) for target projects. The FLOW repo's
own `.claude/settings.json` is updated on the base branch after
the PR merges, or during the next `/flow:flow-prime` run.

### Mechanical enforcement at the subprocess layer

`src/promote_permissions.rs::active_flow_gate` blocks
`bin/flow promote-permissions` mid-flow. Before the merge runs, it
walks up the resolved `--worktree-path` looking for
`.flow-states/`, derives the branch via
`crate::hooks::detect_branch_from_path`, and checks
`crate::hooks::is_flow_active(&branch, &main_root)`. When a flow
is active and the caller did NOT pass `--confirm-on-flow-branch`,
the gate returns:

```json
{"status": "skipped", "reason": "active_flow",
 "message": "...", "branch": "<branch>"}
```

The local settings file is preserved across the skip so a
confirmed retry (by a caller that passes `--confirm-on-flow-branch`)
completes the merge.

The `--confirm-on-flow-branch` flag is the bypass. Any caller
documenting a legitimate mid-flow promotion must pass it.

## Shared Config Files — Express User Permission Required

Some files in the worktree are not FLOW state and not task-scoped
code — they are shared configuration that affects every engineer
working in the repository. These files must not be modified during
an active FLOW phase without explicit user permission, even when
the change would simplify the current task.

The canonical list:

- `.gitignore` / `.gitattributes` — affect every git operation
  across all engineers on the branch
- `Makefile`, `Rakefile`, `justfile`, `package.json`,
  `requirements.txt`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml` — shared build and
  dependency config (modifications may churn lockfiles and shift
  versions under other engineers' feet)
- `.github/` (workflows, issue templates, CODEOWNERS) — affect
  every PR in the repo
- `.config/` (everything under it — `nextest.toml`, build profile
  configs, language-toolchain configs, etc.) — shared
  build/test infrastructure that every engineer's CI run inherits
- `.claude/settings.json` — covered by "Never Edit Permissions
  Mid-Flow" above

When a PR's scope is narrow (e.g., "fix one typo in a doc
comment"), editing any of these files expands the diff into
territory the user never agreed to review.

## The Correct Path

When a task's natural cleanup requires modifying a shared config
file, stop and ask the user:

> "The cleanest solution here requires adding one line to
> `.gitignore` (or modifying `.github/workflows/ci.yml`,
> `.config/nextest.toml`, etc.). This is shared config that
> every engineer reads. May I modify it, or should I change the
> approach to avoid the edit?"

Prefer approaches that keep the diff scoped to task-relevant
code. Ask before expanding scope into shared territory. If the
user approves the edit, proceed. If not, find a different path.

### When the gate blocks an unapproved edit

When an Edit/Write on a shared-config file is attempted inside a
worktree without prior approval, `validate_shared_config` blocks
it. The block is a confirm-and-proceed gate with a two-half
recovery the model cannot self-authorize:

1. The block message instructs the **user** to reply with the
   exact line `approve shared-config: <path>`. The model does NOT
   ask via `AskUserQuestion` and does NOT run anything until that
   exact user reply lands — the user-typed phrase is the
   authorization anchor (the same unforgeable trust model as
   `clear-halt`: a real user-typed turn the model cannot
   synthesize).
2. After the user has replied, the model runs `bin/flow
   approve-shared-config --path <path>`. That subcommand
   self-gates on the persisted transcript via
   `transcript_walker::user_approved_shared_config_edit` — it
   requires the most recent real user turn to carry the fixed
   phrase for that exact path AND a genuine system-emitted
   shared-config block for that full path in the same exchange.
   Only then does it write a single-use approval marker
   (`src/shared_config_approval.rs`,
   `.flow-states/<branch>/shared-config-approvals/<sha256(path)>`).
3. `validate_shared_config` consults and consumes (deletes) the
   marker immediately before its block return, allowing exactly
   one Edit/Write of exactly that file. A second edit re-blocks
   (single-use). Any unreadable, oversized, unparseable, or
   target-mismatched marker yields no approval and the gate keeps
   blocking — fail-closed, a corrupt marker is never an escape
   hatch (the deliberate asymmetry vs. Layer 11's fail-open).

A `not_user_approved` result from `bin/flow approve-shared-config`
means the user has not yet replied with the exact line: keep
waiting for the user — do not retry the edit or re-run the
subcommand in a loop.

## Enforcement

Shared-config protection is a workflow discipline, not a universal
rule. Outside a flow context, users can modify shared config
freely. Once a flow starts and the session is inside a worktree,
the gate activates to enforce the explicit-permission requirement.

The `validate-worktree-paths` PreToolUse hook
(`src/hooks/validate_worktree_paths.rs`) enforces this rule
mechanically. The `is_shared_config` predicate matches the nine
canonical filenames (`.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`, `Makefile`,
`Rakefile`, `justfile`, `package.json`, `requirements.txt`,
`go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`) plus any path passing through a `.github/`
directory component.

**Coverage gap.** The hook does NOT yet match `.config/` paths
(e.g., `.config/nextest.toml`). The prose rule above forbids
unapproved edits to those files; the hook does not yet enforce
them. Until the hook is extended, the model must follow the prose
rule manually for `.config/` writes.

The `validate_shared_config` function gates on tool name: only
`Edit` and `Write` tool calls are blocked (exit 2). `Read`,
`Glob`, and `Grep` calls pass through. The block fires only when
the CWD is inside a `.worktrees/` directory and the target path
is inside the worktree.

The block message names the recovery path: the user must reply
with the exact line `approve shared-config: <path>` and the model
then runs `bin/flow approve-shared-config --path <path>`.
Immediately before the block return, `validate_shared_config`
calls `shared_config_approval::check_and_consume_approval` keyed
on `(project_root, branch, file_path)` — a valid unconsumed
single-use marker allows the edit exactly once (the marker is
deleted on the allow path); any marker IO/parse/validation error
keeps blocking (fail-closed). The block message also points to
this section for context.

### Autonomous-phase carve-out for the confirmation prompt

The model never fires an `AskUserQuestion` for a shared-config
edit — the recovery is the user-typed `approve shared-config:
<path>` phrase plus `bin/flow approve-shared-config`, neither of
which is a model-initiated prompt. The `validate-ask-user`
shared-config carve-out
(`recent_edit_blocked_on_shared_config`) nonetheless remains as a
system-initiated-prompt safety net: the block message still
contains the load-bearing substring `is a shared configuration
file that affects every engineer`, so if a system-initiated
confirmation prompt is raised during an in-progress autonomous
phase in response to a recent shared-config block, the carve-out
lets it fire rather than deadlocking against the autonomous-phase
block in `validate-ask-user`.

The carve-out is system-initiated, not model-initiated, so it
does not violate the autonomous-mode discipline against
self-imposed pauses. See
`.claude/rules/autonomous-phase-discipline.md` "Shared-Config
Carve-Out" subsection for the helper, the detection signal, and
the ordering relative to the user-only-skill carve-out.

## Upstream Principle: No Escape Hatches

The `FLOW_DENY` patterns enumerated above and the structural
escape-hatch layer in `validate-pretool` are both expressions of
the same principle: use sanctioned tools; never route around them.
`.claude/rules/no-escape-hatches.md` is the authoritative articulation
of that principle, and it lists every program/flag combination the
deny list covers along with the sanctioned alternative for each.

When extending `FLOW_DENY` to cover a new escape-hatch program or
flag combination, update the Canonical Escape-Hatch Shapes table
in `no-escape-hatches.md` in the same PR so the rule prose and
the mechanical deny list stay synchronized.
