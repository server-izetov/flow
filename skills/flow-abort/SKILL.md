# FLOW Abort

Abandon the current feature completely. This is the escape hatch — available
from any phase, no prerequisites.

## Usage

```text
/flow:flow-abort
```

- `/flow:flow-abort` — uses the configured mode from the state file's `skills.flow-abort` config

## Concurrency

This flow is one of potentially many running simultaneously — on this
machine (multiple worktrees) and across machines (multiple engineers).
Your state file (`.flow-states/<branch>/state.json`) is yours alone. Never
read or write another branch's state. All local artifacts (logs, plan
files, temp files) are scoped by branch name. GitHub state (PRs, issues,
labels) is shared across all engineers — operations that create or modify
shared state must be idempotent.

## Mode Resolution

Resolve the mode as the first action on entry, after resolving the
current branch. `## Mode Resolution` is the single runnable home for
mode resolution — the same pattern `flow-complete` uses, so the two
terminal skills stay consistent. There are no `--auto`/`--manual`
flags — the state file's `skills.flow-abort` config is the single
source of truth for skill autonomy.

1. Resolve the current branch: run `git worktree list --porcelain`,
   note the project root (the path on the first `worktree` line),
   find the `worktree` entry whose path matches the current working
   directory, and take the `branch refs/heads/<name>` line from that
   entry (strip the `refs/heads/` prefix). Call this `<branch>`.
2. Run the resolver below and use the `continue` field from its JSON
   output as the abort-confirmation mode. It reads the
   `skills.flow-abort` entry in the state file, tolerating every
   object config shape, and falls back to **manual** when the config
   is missing or unparseable:

   ```bash
   ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow resolve-skill-mode --skill flow-abort --branch <branch>
   ```

## Entry Check

Run this entry check immediately after Mode Resolution.

1. Run `git worktree list --porcelain`. Note the path on the first
   `worktree` line (this is the project root). Find the `worktree` entry
   whose path matches your current working directory — the
   `branch refs/heads/<name>` line in that entry is the current branch
   (strip the `refs/heads/` prefix).
2. Use the Read tool to read `<project_root>/.flow-states/<branch>/state.json`.
   - If the file exists: extract `feature`, `branch`, `worktree`,
     `pr_number`, and `pr_url`. Print the feature name, branch, PR URL,
     and current phase.
   - If the file does not exist: infer what you can from git state:
     - `branch` from the porcelain output (already known)
     - Detect worktree path from the porcelain output
     - Use the branch name as the feature name
     - `pr_number` unknown — skip PR close step later
     - Print "WARNING: No state file found for branch '<branch>'. Will
       attempt best-effort cleanup using git state." and tell the user
       what was inferred. Continue — do not stop.

If the Read tool fails for any other reason, stop and show the error.

Use these values for all subsequent steps — do not re-read the state file
or re-run git commands to gather the same information.

## Announce

At the very start, output the following banner in your response (not via Bash) inside a fenced code block:

````markdown
```text
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
  FLOW v2.5.0 — Abort — STARTING
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
```
````

## Steps

### Step 1 — Confirm with user (manual mode only)

Skip this step if mode is **auto** — proceed directly to Steps 2–7.

If mode is **manual**, this is destructive and irreversible. Use AskUserQuestion.

If the entry check printed warnings, include them in the confirmation:

> "Abort feature '<feature>'?
> ⚠ <any warnings from the entry check>
> This will close the PR, delete the remote branch, remove the worktree, and delete the state file and log. All uncommitted work in the worktree will be lost."

- **Yes, abort everything** — proceed
- **No, keep going** — stop here

### Step 2 — Remove In-Progress labels

If a state file was found in the entry check, remove the "Flow In-Progress"
label from any issues referenced in the prompt. Best-effort — continue to
cleanup even if removal fails. Skip this step if no state file exists.

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow label-issues --state-file <project_root>/.flow-states/<branch>/state.json --remove
```

### Steps 3–8 — Run cleanup script

Run the cleanup script from the project root with abort flags:

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow cleanup <project_root> --branch <branch> --worktree <worktree_path> --pr <pr_number>
```

If `pr_number` is unknown, omit `--pr`. The cleanup script deletes local branches and attempts remote branch deletion when `--pr` is provided.

The script outputs JSON with a `steps` dict showing what happened to each resource: `pr_close`, `worktree`, `remote_branch`, `local_branch`, `branch_dir`, `queue_entry`. Each step reports `"closed"`/`"removed"`/`"deleted"`, `"skipped"`, or `"failed: <reason>"`. The `branch_dir` step recursively removes every per-branch artifact under `.flow-states/<branch>/` (state file, log, plan, frozen phases, CI sentinel, timings, closed-issues record, issues summary, scratch rule content, commit message, start prompt). The `queue_entry` step removes `.flow-states/start-queue/<branch>` if a start-lock entry remains.

### Done

Tell the user what was cleaned, what was already gone, and what failed.

Then output the following banner in your response (not via Bash) inside a fenced code block:

````markdown
```text
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  ✓ FLOW v2.5.0 — Abort — COMPLETE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  Feature '<feature>' has been abandoned.
  Cleanup complete — see results above for details.
```
````

Report which steps succeeded and which were already cleaned up.

## Rules

- Available from ANY phase — no phase gate
- Never run from inside the worktree — always navigate to project root first
- Confirm with the user only when mode is **manual**
- Every step after confirmation is best-effort — if one fails, continue to the next
- Never rebase, never force push — just close and delete
