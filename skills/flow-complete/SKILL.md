# FLOW Complete — Phase 5: Complete

## Usage

```text
/flow:flow-complete
/flow:flow-complete --auto
/flow:flow-complete --manual
/flow:flow-complete --continue-step
/flow:flow-complete --continue-step --auto
/flow:flow-complete --continue-step --manual
```

- `/flow:flow-complete` — uses configured mode from the state file (default: auto)
- `/flow:flow-complete --auto` — skips confirmation and proceeds directly
- `/flow:flow-complete --manual` — prompts for user confirmation before merge
- `/flow:flow-complete --continue-step` — self-invocation: skip Announce and SOFT-GATE, dispatch to the next step via Resume Check

## Concurrency

This flow is one of potentially many running simultaneously — on this
machine (multiple worktrees) and across machines (multiple engineers).
Your state file (`.flow-states/<branch>/state.json`) is yours alone. Never
read or write another branch's state. All local artifacts (logs, plan
files, temp files) are scoped by branch name. GitHub state (PRs, issues,
labels) is shared across all engineers — operations that create or modify
shared state must be idempotent.

## Mode Resolution

1. If `--auto` was passed → mode is **auto**
2. If `--manual` was passed → mode is **manual**
3. Otherwise, read the state file at `<project_root>/.flow-states/<branch>/state.json`. Use `skills.flow-complete` value.
4. If the state file has no `skills` key → use built-in default: **auto**

## Self-Invocation Check

If `--continue-step` was passed, this is a self-invocation from a
previous step's commit. Skip the Announce banner and proceed directly
to the Resume Check section.

Run `git worktree list --porcelain`. Note the path on the first
`worktree` line (this is the project root). Find the `worktree` entry
whose path matches your current working directory — the
`branch refs/heads/<name>` line in that entry is the current branch
(strip the `refs/heads/` prefix).

Use the Read tool to read `<project_root>/.flow-states/<branch>/state.json`
to get the state data (`feature`, `branch`, `worktree`, `pr_number`,
`pr_url`). Proceed directly to the Resume Check section.

<SOFT-GATE>
Run this entry check as your very first action. This gate never
blocks — it records warnings for the confirmation step.

1. Run `git worktree list --porcelain`. Note the path on the first
   `worktree` line (this is the project root). Find the `worktree` entry
   whose path matches your current working directory — the
   `branch refs/heads/<name>` line in that entry is the current branch
   (strip the `refs/heads/` prefix).
2. Use the Read tool to read `<project_root>/.flow-states/<branch>/state.json`.
   - If the file exists: extract `feature`, `branch`, `worktree`, `pr_number`,
     `pr_url`, and `cumulative_seconds`. Check `phases.flow-learn.status` — if
     not `"complete"`, record warning "Phase 4 not complete (status: <actual status>)."
   - If the file does not exist: record warning "No state file found for
     branch '<branch>'."
3. Clear any fossil `_drift_recovery_attempted` flag. The SOFT-GATE
   runs only on fresh, non-`--continue-step` invocations, so a flag
   that survives into this step is a fossil from a previously aborted
   Complete invocation that was killed mid-recovery. Clearing here
   guarantees the next `ci_drift` dispatch can run recovery instead
   of incorrectly escalating, regardless of what `complete_step` value
   the state file carries.

   ```bash
   ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow set-timestamp --set _drift_recovery_attempted=
   ```

Use these values for all subsequent steps — do not re-read the state file
or re-run git commands to gather the same information.

Carry any warnings forward to the confirmation step in Step 4.

Resolve the mode using the Mode Resolution rules above.

</SOFT-GATE>

## Announce

At the very start, output the following banner in your response (not via Bash) inside a fenced code block:

````markdown
```text
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
  FLOW v2.1.0 — Phase 5: Complete — STARTING
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
```
````

## Logging

No logging for this phase. Complete deletes the log file as part of its
operation — writing log entries that are immediately deleted is pointless.

---

## Resume Check

Read `complete_step` from the state file (default `0` if absent).

- If `complete_step` is `2`: skip to Step 2 (Run local CI gate).
- If `complete_step` is `3`: skip to Step 3 (Check GitHub CI status).
- If `complete_step` is `4`: skip to Step 4 (Confirm with user).
- If `complete_step` is `5`: skip to Step 5 (Merge PR).
- If `complete_step` is `6`: skip to Step 6 (Finalize).
- If `complete_step` is `0`, `1`, or absent: proceed normally to
  Step 1. (Fossil `_drift_recovery_attempted` cleanup happens in the
  SOFT-GATE on fresh invocations; the legitimate post-ci_drift self-
  invoke arrives via `--continue-step` with `complete_step=1` and
  must NOT clear the flag, since the flag is the loop-guard that
  fires escalation if drift persists after a toolchain refresh.)

---

## Steps

### Step 1 — Run complete-fast

Run the consolidated fast-path command. It handles phase entry, state
detection, PR status check, merge main, local CI dirty check (without
simulate-branch), GitHub CI check, and squash merge — all in a single
call.

Pass the mode flag resolved from Mode Resolution. Each variant below
runs `complete-fast`, which dispatches to `ci::run_impl()` on a
sentinel miss — each invocation needs a 10-minute Bash tool timeout
so CI's 3–4 minute duration does not trip the default 2-minute Bash
tool timeout and background the process, defeating the gate (per
`.claude/rules/ci-is-a-gate.md`).

**Auto mode.** Use a 10-minute Bash tool timeout (`timeout: 600000`).

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow complete-fast --branch <branch> --auto
```

**Manual mode.** Use a 10-minute Bash tool timeout (`timeout: 600000`).

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow complete-fast --branch <branch> --manual
```

**State-file default.** Use a 10-minute Bash tool timeout (`timeout: 600000`).

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow complete-fast --branch <branch>
```

Use the first form when mode is **auto**, the second when **manual**,
the third when no flag was resolved (lets the script decide from the
state file).

Parse the JSON output and dispatch on the `path` field:

**If `"path": "merged"`** — the PR is merged (auto mode happy path).
Skip directly to Step 6 (finalize).

**If `"path": "already_merged"`** — the PR was already merged before
this invocation. Skip directly to Step 6 (finalize).

**If `"path": "confirm"`** — manual mode. All CI checks passed. Skip
to Step 4 (confirm with user).

**If `"path": "ci_stale"`** — main was merged into the branch and the
tree changed. Set the resume step and self-invoke to run CI:

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow set-timestamp --set complete_step=2
```

If mode is **auto**, use the first form. If mode is **manual**, use the second:

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow set-timestamp --set "_continue_context=Self-invoke flow:flow-complete --continue-step --auto."
```

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow set-timestamp --set "_continue_context=Self-invoke flow:flow-complete --continue-step --manual."
```

To continue, invoke `flow:flow-complete --continue-step` using
the Skill tool as your final action. If mode was resolved to auto, pass
`--auto` as well. Do not output anything else after this invocation.

**If `"path": "ci_drift"`** — local CI passed on this exact tree but
GitHub CI failed. This signals tool version drift between the
developer machine and the CI runner (formatter, linter, language
runtime version skew). The recovery is deterministic — refresh the
toolchain locally, invalidate the CI sentinel, re-run CI on the
upgraded tools, commit any auto-fixes, and re-check. Do not invoke
`ci-fixer`: the same reasoning already failed in the manual case.

First, read `_drift_recovery_attempted` from the state file via the
Read tool on `<project_root>/.flow-states/<branch>/state.json`. If
the flag is set (non-empty), recovery already ran in this Complete
invocation and the drift persists — escalate to the user:

> "GitHub CI continues to fail after a local toolchain refresh. The
> cause is likely environmental: CI runtime version, missing env var,
> or platform-specific behavior. Inspect failing checks with
> `gh pr checks <pr_number>` and resolve manually."

Stop. Do not loop the recovery again.

Otherwise, set the loop-guard flag BEFORE running the recovery so a
kill-signal mid-recovery still produces a flagged state (the next
entry escalates rather than re-loops):

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow set-timestamp --set _drift_recovery_attempted=1
```

Check for `<worktree>/bin/dependencies` using the Read tool. If the
file does NOT exist, the project has no dependency-refresh script —
dispatch as if the path had been `ci_failed`: launch the `ci-fixer`
sub-agent with the message "Local CI passed; GitHub CI failed.
Project has no `bin/dependencies` script to refresh the toolchain.
Diagnose GitHub CI failure directly." Then follow the `ci_failed`
recovery path below.

If `bin/dependencies` exists, refresh the toolchain from the worktree
cwd:

```bash
bin/dependencies
```

Re-run CI with the upgraded toolchain. Use a 10-minute Bash tool
timeout (`timeout: 600000`) — CI runs can take 3–4 minutes and the
default 2-minute timeout would background the process, defeating the
gate (per `.claude/rules/ci-is-a-gate.md`). The `--force` flag
invalidates the existing sentinel so the new toolchain actually runs
every tool:

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow ci --force
```

If `bin/flow ci --force` exits non-zero, the toolchain refresh did
NOT resolve the drift — it surfaced fresh local breakage on the
upgraded tools (a yanked dependency, a breaking version bump, a
formatter that disagrees with existing code, etc.). Launch the
`ci-fixer` sub-agent to diagnose and fix. Use the Agent tool:

- `subagent_type`: `"flow:ci-fixer"`
- `description`: `"Fix CI failures after toolchain refresh"`

Provide the `bin/flow ci --force` output in the prompt with the
context "Local CI passed against the previous toolchain but failed
remotely (ci_drift). Toolchain refresh via `bin/dependencies` ran;
the post-refresh `bin/flow ci --force` failed locally." so the
sub-agent knows the dependency state changed.

If the sub-agent fixes CI, fall through to the working-tree check
below (the fixes typically dirty the tree, so the commit path
catches them). If not fixed after 3 attempts, stop and report.

If `bin/dependencies` or `bin/flow ci --force` produced working-tree
changes (auto-formatter / linter rewrites are common after a
toolchain bump, and ci-fixer changes are also captured here),
commit them. Otherwise, skip directly to the self-invoke. Check
via:

```bash
git diff --quiet
```

If the exit code is non-zero (working tree dirty), set the resume
step and the continuation flag:

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow set-timestamp --set complete_step=1
```

If mode is **auto**, use the first form. If mode is **manual**, use the second:

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow set-timestamp --set "_continue_context=Self-invoke flow:flow-complete --continue-step --auto."
```

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow set-timestamp --set "_continue_context=Self-invoke flow:flow-complete --continue-step --manual."
```

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow set-timestamp --set _continue_pending=commit
```

Commit the auto-fixes via `/flow:flow-commit`.

To re-check both local and remote CI on the refreshed toolchain,
invoke `flow:flow-complete --continue-step` using the Skill tool as
your final action. If mode was resolved to auto, pass `--auto` as
well. Do not output anything else after this invocation.

**If `"path": "ci_failed"`** — local CI or GitHub CI failed. Launch the
`ci-fixer` sub-agent to diagnose and fix. Use the Agent tool:

- `subagent_type`: `"flow:ci-fixer"`
- `description`: `"Fix CI failures before merge"`

Provide the `output` field from the JSON in the prompt so the sub-agent
knows what failed.

If fixed, set the resume step, continuation flags, and commit:

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow set-timestamp --set complete_step=2
```

If mode is **auto**, use the first form. If mode is **manual**, use the second:

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow set-timestamp --set "_continue_context=Self-invoke flow:flow-complete --continue-step --auto."
```

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow set-timestamp --set "_continue_context=Self-invoke flow:flow-complete --continue-step --manual."
```

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow set-timestamp --set _continue_pending=commit
```

Commit the fixes via `/flow:flow-commit`.

To re-check CI, invoke `flow:flow-complete --continue-step` using
the Skill tool as your final action. If mode was resolved to auto, pass
`--auto` as well. Do not output anything else after this invocation.

If not fixed after 3 attempts, stop and report.

**If `"path": "ci_pending"`** — GitHub CI has not finished. Record the
resume step:

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow set-timestamp --set complete_step=3
```

Then invoke the `loop` skill via the Skill tool with args `15s /flow:flow-complete` and return. The loop will re-invoke the complete skill automatically until CI completes.

**If `"path": "conflict"`** — merge conflicts detected. The
`conflict_files` array lists the conflicted files.

1. Read each conflicted file using the Read tool
2. Resolve the conflicts using the Edit tool — you have full context of the
   feature from this session
3. Set the resume step, continuation flag, and commit the resolution

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow set-timestamp --set complete_step=2
```

If mode is **auto**, use the first form. If mode is **manual**, use the second:

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow set-timestamp --set "_continue_context=Self-invoke flow:flow-complete --continue-step --auto."
```

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow set-timestamp --set "_continue_context=Self-invoke flow:flow-complete --continue-step --manual."
```

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow set-timestamp --set _continue_pending=commit
```

Commit the resolution via `/flow:flow-commit` — the commit skill handles
staging, diff review, and push.

To continue to Step 2, invoke `flow:flow-complete --continue-step` using
the Skill tool as your final action. If mode was resolved to auto, pass
`--auto` as well. Do not output anything else after this invocation.

**If `"path": "max_retries"`** — stop and report to the user:
> "High contention: main has moved 3 times since the CI gate. Another
> engineer is merging frequently. Wait for a quieter window and
> re-invoke `/flow:flow-complete`."

**If `"status": "error"`** — stop and report the error to the user.
Do not retry the command with any additional flags or elevated privileges.

Check the `warnings` array from the output. Carry any warnings forward
to the confirmation step in Step 4.

### Step 2 — Run local CI gate

Run CI locally. Use a 10-minute Bash tool timeout (`timeout: 600000`)
— CI runs can take 3–4 minutes and the default 2-minute timeout
would background the process, defeating the gate (per
`.claude/rules/ci-is-a-gate.md`).

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow ci
```

If it passes, continue to Step 3.

If it fails, launch the `ci-fixer` sub-agent to diagnose and fix.
Use the Agent tool:

- `subagent_type`: `"flow:ci-fixer"`
- `description`: `"Fix CI failures before merge"`

If fixed, record the resume step, set continuation flags, commit, and
self-invoke to re-check:

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow set-timestamp --set complete_step=2
```

If mode is **auto**, use the first form. If mode is **manual**, use the second:

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow set-timestamp --set "_continue_context=Self-invoke flow:flow-complete --continue-step --auto."
```

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow set-timestamp --set "_continue_context=Self-invoke flow:flow-complete --continue-step --manual."
```

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow set-timestamp --set _continue_pending=commit
```

Commit the fixes via `/flow:flow-commit`.

Self-invoke `flow:flow-complete --continue-step` to re-run Step 2.
If mode was resolved to auto, pass `--auto` as well.

If not fixed after 3 attempts, stop and report.

### Step 3 — Check GitHub CI status

Check the CI status on the PR:

```bash
gh pr checks <pr_number>
```

Parse the output. Each check has a status: pass, fail, or pending.

**If all checks pass** — continue to Step 4.

**If any check is pending** — record the resume step so re-entry skips
straight to Step 3:

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow set-timestamp --set complete_step=3
```

Then invoke the `loop` skill via the Skill tool with args `15s /flow:flow-complete` and return. The loop will re-invoke the complete skill automatically until CI completes.

**If any check has failed** — launch the `ci-fixer` sub-agent to diagnose
and fix. Use the Agent tool:

- `subagent_type`: `"flow:ci-fixer"`
- `description`: `"Fix CI failures on PR branch"`

Provide the full `gh pr checks` output in the prompt so the sub-agent
knows what failed.

Wait for the sub-agent to return.

- **Fixed** — record the resume step and set continuation flags before
committing:

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow set-timestamp --set complete_step=2
```

If mode is **auto**, use the first form. If mode is **manual**, use the second:

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow set-timestamp --set "_continue_context=Self-invoke flow:flow-complete --continue-step --auto."
```

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow set-timestamp --set "_continue_context=Self-invoke flow:flow-complete --continue-step --manual."
```

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow set-timestamp --set _continue_pending=commit
```

Commit the fixes via `/flow:flow-commit`.

To re-check CI, invoke `flow:flow-complete --continue-step` using
the Skill tool as your final action. If mode was resolved to auto, pass
`--auto` as well. Do not output anything else after this invocation.

If still failing after 3 attempts, stop and report.

- **Not fixed** — stop and report to the user.

### Step 4 — Confirm with user (manual mode only)

Skip this step if mode is **auto** — proceed directly to Step 5.

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow set-timestamp --set complete_step=4
```

**Resolve the integration branch.** Before composing the prompt,
run `bin/flow base-branch` to retrieve the integration branch the
flow coordinates against. Capture its stdout — call the value
`<base_branch>` — and substitute it into the prompt below. A repo
whose default branch is `staging` produces `<base_branch> =
staging`; a standard repo produces `<base_branch> = main`.

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow base-branch
```

<HARD-GATE>
If mode is **manual**, use AskUserQuestion. If the preflight recorded
warnings, include them:

> "PR #<pr_number> is green and ready to merge. Squash-merge '<feature>' into <base_branch>?
> <pr_url>"
> ⚠ <any warnings from the preflight>

If no warnings:

> "PR #<pr_number> is green and ready to merge. Squash-merge '<feature>' into <base_branch>?
> <pr_url>"

Options:

- **Yes, merge and clean up** — proceed to Step 5
- **No, not yet** — stop here
- **I have feedback on the code** — describe the issue

Do NOT proceed to Step 5, do NOT merge, do NOT take any action outside
this step until the user explicitly selects an option. Freeform text
that is not one of the listed options is feedback — treat it the same
as selecting "I have feedback on the code".

**If "Yes, merge and clean up"** — proceed to Step 5.

**If "No, not yet"** — stop here.

**If "I have feedback on the code"** (or freeform feedback):

Ask the user to describe the issue if they have not already. Fix the
code to address the feedback.

Set the continuation context and flag before committing:

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow set-timestamp --set "_continue_context=Set complete_step=2, then self-invoke flow:flow-complete --continue-step --manual."
```

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow set-timestamp --set _continue_pending=commit
```

Commit the fixes via `/flow:flow-commit`.

After the commit completes, record the resume step:

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow set-timestamp --set complete_step=2
```

To loop back through CI, invoke `flow:flow-complete --continue-step --manual`
using the Skill tool as your final action. Do not output anything else
after this invocation.

</HARD-GATE>

### Step 5 — Merge PR

Skip this step if the PR was already merged in Step 1 (complete-fast
returned `"merged"` or `"already_merged"`).

**Resolve the integration branch.** Before running the merge command,
run `bin/flow base-branch` to retrieve the integration branch the
flow coordinates against. Capture its stdout — call the value
`<base_branch>` — and use it in the success message below. A repo
whose default branch is `staging` produces `<base_branch> =
staging`; a standard repo produces `<base_branch> = main`.

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow base-branch
```

For manual mode (after Step 4 confirmation), run the merge command:

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow complete-merge --pr <pr_number> --state-file <project_root>/.flow-states/<branch>/state.json
```

Parse the JSON output and handle each status:

**If `"status": "merged"`** — the PR is merged. Report to the user
using the `<base_branch>` value resolved at the top of this step:

> "PR #<pr_number> merged into <base_branch>."

Continue to Step 6.

**If `"status": "ci_rerun"`** — main had new commits that were merged
into the branch without conflicts. The branch was pushed. Loop back
to re-run CI:

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow set-timestamp --set complete_step=2
```

To re-run CI, invoke `flow:flow-complete --continue-step` using the
Skill tool as your final action. If mode was resolved to auto, pass
`--auto` as well. Do not output anything else after this invocation.

**If `"status": "ci_pending"`** — GitHub CI has not finished on the
latest commits. Set the resume step and self-invoke to wait for CI:

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow set-timestamp --set complete_step=3
```

Invoke `flow:flow-complete --continue-step` using the Skill tool as
your final action. If mode was resolved to auto, pass `--auto` as
well. Do not output anything else after this invocation.

**If `"status": "conflict"`** — the `conflict_files` array lists the
conflicted files.

1. Read each conflicted file using the Read tool
2. Resolve the conflicts using the Edit tool — you have full context of
   the feature from this session
3. Record the resume step, set continuation flags, and commit

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow set-timestamp --set complete_step=2
```

If mode is **auto**, use the first form. If mode is **manual**, use the second:

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow set-timestamp --set "_continue_context=Self-invoke flow:flow-complete --continue-step --auto."
```

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow set-timestamp --set "_continue_context=Self-invoke flow:flow-complete --continue-step --manual."
```

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow set-timestamp --set _continue_pending=commit
```

Commit the resolution via `/flow:flow-commit` — the commit skill handles
staging, diff review, and push.

To continue to Step 2, invoke `flow:flow-complete --continue-step` using
the Skill tool as your final action. If mode was resolved to auto, pass
`--auto` as well. Do not output anything else after this invocation.

**If `"status": "max_retries"`** — stop and report to the user:
> "High contention: main has moved 3 times since the CI gate. Another
> engineer is merging frequently. Wait for a quieter window and
> re-invoke `/flow:flow-complete`."

**If `"status": "error"`** — stop and report the error to the user.
Do not retry the merge command with any additional flags or elevated
privileges.

### Step 6 — Finalize: post-merge + cleanup

The next step removes the worktree. Navigate to the project root first
so the shell does not end up stranded inside a deleted directory.
`complete-finalize` self-gates against this — when its canonicalized
cwd equals or sits beneath the canonicalized `--worktree`, it returns
`{"status":"error","reason":"cwd_inside_worktree"}` before any side
effect, so a missed `cd` produces a clean error rather than shell
corruption. Run the `cd` anyway — it is the simpler path:

```bash
cd <project_root>
```

Run the consolidated finalize command. It handles phase-transition
complete, render-pr-body, format-issues-summary, close-issues,
format-complete-summary, label-issues with --remove, auto-close-parent,
notify-slack, worktree removal, state file deletion, and git pull —
all best-effort in a single call.

The render-pr-body step produces the PR body with all sections —
What, Artifacts, Plan, DAG Analysis, Phase Timings, Token Cost,
Review Findings, Learn Findings, State File, Session Log, and
Issues Filed — from the state file and available artifact files.
Sections with missing data are omitted automatically.

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow complete-finalize --pr <pr_number> --state-file <project_root>/.flow-states/<branch>/state.json --branch <branch> --worktree <worktree_path> --pull
```

Parse the JSON output.

**If `"status": "error"` and `"reason": "cwd_inside_worktree"`** —
the self-gate fired because the `cd <project_root>` above was missed
(or the cwd drifted back into the worktree). The worktree was NOT
removed. Re-run the `cd <project_root>` command above and re-invoke
`complete-finalize` once. If the second invocation also returns
`cwd_inside_worktree`, stop and report the error to the user — the
project root path is unresolvable in this session and manual
intervention is needed.

**On success** — keep `formatted_time`, `cumulative_seconds`,
`summary`, `issues_links`, and `banner_line` for the Done banner.

The `cleanup` field contains the results of Step 7 (cleanup operations):
worktree removal, state file and log deletion, local branch cleanup, and
git pull. Report the results to the user: what was cleaned, what was
already gone, and what failed.

If the output has a non-empty `post_merge_failures` dict, note the
failures but continue — all post-merge operations are best-effort.

### Step 7 — Cleanup results

The cleanup operations were performed as part of the complete-finalize
call in Step 6. The `cleanup` field in the JSON output shows what
happened to each resource (pr\_close, worktree\_tmp, worktree,
remote\_branch, local\_branch, state\_file, plan\_file, dag\_file,
log\_file, frozen\_phases, ci\_sentinel, timings\_file,
closed\_issues\_file, issues\_file, adversarial\_test — plus
git\_pull when the Complete path runs with `--pull`).
Each step reports "closed"/"removed"/"deleted"/"pulled", "skipped", or
"failed: reason". The `adversarial_test` step matches
`.flow-states/<branch>/adversarial_test.*` so the Phase 3 adversarial
agent's temp file is removed regardless of the runtime-chosen extension.

Report the results to the user: what was cleaned, what was already gone,
and what failed.

### Done — Print banner

Output the COMPLETE banner line, the summary from Step 6, and cleanup
status in your response (not via Bash) inside a single fenced code block:

The summary already includes the feature name, prompt, PR: <pr_url>,
per-phase timeline (Start:, Plan:, Code:, Review:, Learn:,
Complete:, Total:), Review Findings and Learn Findings sections
(each finding with its outcome marker and reasoning), the Token Cost
section (per-phase token totals + cost in USD, plus a Total row; an
optional By Model breakdown when 2+ models contributed; an optional
"↻" marker and footer note when a rate-limit window reset was
observed mid-flow — the section renders one row per non-pending
phase and is omitted entirely only when every phase is still
"pending"), and artifact counts (issues filed count, notes
captured count). Do not add a separate PR line — it is part of
the summary.

The Token Cost section uses these conditional output markers when
snapshot data is incomplete:

- **`—` (em-dash)** in the cost column means the per-phase or
  Total cost is unknown for the row. A phase shows `—` when its
  start or end snapshot lacks `session_cost_usd`; the Total row
  shows `—` when no phase contributed a complete cost pair.
- **`*` (asterisk suffix)** on a cost value (e.g. `$0.450*`) marks
  the row as partial: the phase ran but the snapshot data was not
  fully recoverable, so the displayed value is the best-effort
  computation from available endpoints. The Total cost is
  suffixed with `*` when any phase contributed `None` cost into
  the aggregate.
- **`* cost partial — some phases had no cost data`** appears as
  a footnote line below the Total when the Total carries the `*`
  marker, naming the cause so the reader does not have to
  reconstruct it from per-phase rows.

If the `complete-finalize` JSON output has a non-empty
`issues_links` field, render it as regular text (not inside a code
block) immediately after the banner code block. This makes the issue
URLs clickable — URLs inside code blocks are not rendered as links.

After the banner (and issue links if any), write a brief
session summary in natural prose (2-3 sentences). Describe what was
built or fixed, the approach taken, and the outcome. Use your
conversation context — do not fetch additional data or run any
commands. This is a narrative recap, not a structured template.

## Rules

- Steps 1-5 run from the worktree (feature branch); Step 6 (finalize) runs from the project root
- If the merge fails, never retry with additional flags or elevated privileges — report to the user and stop
- Confirm with the user only when mode is **manual**
- State file deletion is what resets the session hook — do not skip it
- Every operation inside `complete-finalize` (Step 6) is best-effort — if one fails, continue to the next
- The skill is idempotent: safe to re-invoke via `/loop` after a "pending CI" stop
- Never use `general-purpose` sub-agents — use `"flow:ci-fixer"` for CI failures
- Never use Bash to print banners — output them as text in your response
- Never use Bash for file reads — use Glob, Read, and Grep tools instead of ls, cat, head, tail, find, or grep
- Never use `cd <path> && git` — use `git -C <path>` for git commands in other directories
- Never cd before running `bin/flow` — it detects the project root internally
- Never discard uncommitted changes to unblock a workflow step — if any git command fails due to uncommitted changes, show `git diff` to the user and ask how to proceed
- When in autonomous mode, classify tool failures per `.claude/rules/autonomous-flow-self-recovery.md` — mechanical fixes are in-flow, substantive failures prompt the user
