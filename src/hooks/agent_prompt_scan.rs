//! Parent-side Agent tool prompt-body scan.
//!
//! Closes the bypass surface where the parent model can route a
//! sub-agent toward out-of-worktree paths by embedding the path
//! verbatim in the Agent tool's `prompt` field. The sub-agent has its
//! own per-tool gates, but those gates run inside the child session;
//! the parent-side scan rejects the Agent call before the child
//! starts so an autonomous flow cannot silently surface a Claude Code
//! permission prompt for a Read on `~/.config/...` or any other
//! out-of-worktree target.
//!
//! Three helpers compose into the public entry point:
//!
//! - `extract_path_candidates` — pure tokenizer that pulls path-shape
//!   substrings out of arbitrary prompt prose. Matches an anchored
//!   regex (`[/.][A-Za-z0-9_./-]{2,}`), then runs a byte-boundary
//!   check on the preceding byte so option-flag pairs (`-l/--long`)
//!   and intra-token slashes do not produce false candidates. URL
//!   shapes (`https://example.com/path`) are filtered when the
//!   preceding byte is `:` AND the match begins with `//` (the
//!   scheme delimiter), so plain colon-prefixed paths like
//!   `time:/etc/hosts` still reach the validator.
//! - `is_safe_path_candidate` — positive validator per
//!   `.claude/rules/external-input-path-construction.md`.
//! - `validate_agent_prompt` — the parent-side entry point.
//!   Composes the helpers, applies the byte cap, resolves
//!   relative candidates against the worktree root, lexically
//!   normalizes the result (no disk touch), and prefix-compares
//!   against the worktree root.
//!
//! The `Constructor Invariant Audit` for this module per
//! `.claude/rules/extract-helper-refactor.md`:
//! `Regex::captures`/`find_iter` return `Option`/`Iterator`,
//! `Path::join` is infallible, `str::split` is non-panicking, and the
//! validator helper is a pure predicate. No `Path::canonicalize` call
//! reaches the filesystem — every path comparison runs on lexically
//! normalized components.
