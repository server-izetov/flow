//! Shared backward walker over the persisted Claude Code transcript
//! JSONL. Three consumers share this module:
//!
//! 1. `src/hooks/validate_skill.rs` — Layer 1 of the user-only skill
//!    enforcement chain. Calls
//!    `last_user_message_invokes_skill(transcript_path, skill, home)`
//!    to decide whether the most recent user turn typed the matching
//!    `<command-name>/<skill></command-name>` slash command. Without
//!    a match, the model invocation of a user-only skill is blocked.
//! 2. `src/hooks/validate_ask_user.rs` — Layer 2 user-only-skill
//!    carve-out. Calls
//!    `most_recent_skill_in_user_only_set(transcript_path, home)` to
//!    allow `AskUserQuestion` confirmation prompts during in-progress
//!    autonomous phases when the most recent assistant turn fires a
//!    Skill tool_use targeting a user-only skill.
//! 3. `src/hooks/validate_ask_user.rs` — shared-config carve-out.
//!    Calls `recent_edit_blocked_on_shared_config(transcript_path, home)`
//!    to allow `AskUserQuestion` confirmation prompts during
//!    in-progress autonomous phases when the most recent user-role
//!    turn carries a `validate_worktree_paths` shared-config edit
//!    block. The shared-config block's BLOCKED message itself
//!    instructs the model to call `AskUserQuestion` to confirm — the
//!    carve-out lets the prompt fire instead of deadlocking.
//!
//! Both helpers are read-only over a JSONL transcript file. They
//! never mutate state, never spawn subprocesses, and fail-open
//! (return `false`) on any I/O, parse, or validation error. The
//! `false` return surfaces as "no match" at every consumer, which
//! routes through to the consumer's safe default (block for Layer
//! 1, fall through to existing autonomous block for Layer 2).
//!
//! ## Validation contract
//!
//! Per `.claude/rules/external-input-path-construction.md`, the
//! `path` argument is validated through
//! `crate::session_metrics::is_safe_transcript_path` before any
//! filesystem read. The validator rejects empty paths, NUL-byte
//! paths, relative paths, paths containing a `..` component, and
//! paths that do not normalize under `<home>/.claude/projects/`.
//!
//! ## Tail-bounded read
//!
//! `read_capped` seeks to the LAST `cap` bytes of the file and reads
//! forward to EOF, with the consumed read hard-bounded at `cap` via
//! `file.take(cap)`. The walker iterates the resulting buffer in
//! reverse line order, so the file's tail (the most recent turns) is
//! always visible regardless of total file size. The two callers
//! choose different caps tuned to their recency needs:
//! `TRANSCRIPT_BYTE_CAP` (50 MB) for user-only-skill detection
//! across long autonomous flows, and `SHARED_CONFIG_BLOCK_BYTE_CAP`
//! (4 MB) for shared-config carve-out detection where only the most
//! recent user-role turn matters.
//!
//! ## Gate normalization
//!
//! Per `.claude/rules/security-gates.md` "Normalize Before
//! Comparing", every gate-relevant string input is normalized
//! through `normalize_gate_input` (NUL strip + trim + ASCII
//! lowercase) before comparison. This applies to `skill` values,
//! transcript-extracted skill names, and turn-type discriminants.
//! Both sides of every comparison run through the same normalizer.
//!
//! ## Slash-command anchoring
//!
//! Layer 1's user-turn check parses `message.content` as a string
//! and requires the `<command-name>/<skill></command-name>`
//! marker at the START of the trimmed content. A user typing
//! "what does <command-name>/flow:flow-abort</command-name> do?"
//! produces a content string where the marker appears mid-text —
//! that is prose mention, not a slash-command invocation, and is
//! rejected. Tool-result-wrapped user turns (where `content` is an
//! array of blocks rather than a string) are also rejected
//! because echoed assistant text in a tool_result would otherwise
//! authorize invocation of a user-only skill.
//!
//! ## JSONL turn shape
//!
//! Mirrors `crate::session_metrics::read_transcript`. Each line is
//! a JSON object with a top-level `type` field whose value is
//! `"user"` or `"assistant"`. The line's payload lives under
//! `message.content` — a string for user-typed turns, an array of
//! content blocks (`{"type": "tool_use", "name": "Skill",
//! "input": {"skill": "..."}}`, etc.) for assistant turns and
//! tool_result-wrapped user turns. Lines that fail to parse as
//! JSON are skipped silently.
//!
//! Tests live at `tests/transcript_walker.rs` (top-level rather
//! than the mirror `tests/hooks/transcript_walker.rs`) per the
//! deviation log entry on this branch — adding a `[[test]]`
//! stanza for the subdirectory test was blocked by the
//! validate-worktree-paths shared-config hook in autonomous mode.
