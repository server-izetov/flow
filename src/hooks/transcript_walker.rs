//! Shared backward walker over the persisted Claude Code transcript
//! JSONL. Four consumers share this module:
//!
//! 1. `src/hooks/validate_skill.rs` — Layer 1 of the user-only skill
//!    enforcement chain. Calls
//!    `last_user_message_invokes_skill(transcript_path, skill, home)`
//!    to decide whether the most recent user turn typed the matching
//!    `<command-name>/<skill></command-name>` slash command. Without
//!    a match, the model invocation of a user-only skill is blocked.
//! 2. `src/hooks/validate_ask_user.rs` — Layer 2 user-only-skill
//!    carve-out. Calls
//!    `most_recent_skill_in_user_only_set(transcript_path, home)` to
//!    allow `AskUserQuestion` confirmation prompts during in-progress
//!    autonomous phases when the most recent assistant turn fires a
//!    Skill tool_use targeting a user-only skill.
//! 3. `src/hooks/validate_ask_user.rs` — shared-config carve-out.
//!    Calls `recent_edit_blocked_on_shared_config(transcript_path, home)`
//!    to allow `AskUserQuestion` confirmation prompts during
//!    in-progress autonomous phases when the most recent user-role
//!    turn carries a `validate_worktree_paths` shared-config edit
//!    block. The shared-config block's BLOCKED message itself
//!    instructs the model to call `AskUserQuestion` to confirm — the
//!    carve-out lets the prompt fire instead of deadlocking.
//! 4. `src/hooks/validate_pretool.rs` — Layer 9 bootstrap-skill
//!    carve-out for the integration-branch commit gate. Calls
//!    `any_skill_in_set_since_user(transcript_path, home, &[
//!    "flow:flow-start", "flow:flow-prime", "flow-release"])` to
//!    recognize the bootstrap commit windows where the commit runs
//!    while cwd is on the integration branch — flow-start Step 2
//!    (deps repair), flow-prime Step 6 (setup writes), and
//!    flow-release's version-bump commit. The sanctioned parent is
//!    recognized either as an assistant `Skill` tool_use OR as the
//!    user-typed slash-command boundary turn since the most recent
//!    real user turn — `flow:flow-prime` and `flow-release` are
//!    user-only skills that Claude Code records only as user-role
//!    turns, never as assistant `Skill` tool_use, so the user-turn
//!    recognition is required for those two.
//!
//! All helpers are read-only over a JSONL transcript file. They
//! never mutate state, never spawn subprocesses, and fail-open
//! (return `false` / `None`) on any I/O, parse, or validation error.
//! The fail-open return surfaces as "no match" at every consumer,
//! which routes through to the consumer's safe default (block for
//! Layer 1, fall through to existing autonomous block for Layer 2,
//! block for Layer 9 commit-gate carve-outs).
//!
//! ## Validation contract
//!
//! Per `.claude/rules/external-input-path-construction.md`, the
//! `path` argument is validated through
//! `crate::session_metrics::is_safe_transcript_path` before any
//! filesystem read. The validator rejects empty paths, NUL-byte
//! paths, relative paths, paths containing a `..` component, and
//! paths that do not normalize under `<home>/.claude/projects/`.
//!
//! ## Three lookback windows
//!
//! Walkers declare their lookback semantics by name. Three public
//! wrappers route every file read:
//!
//! - `read_full` — uncapped. Loads the entire transcript. Used by
//!   phase-boundary verifiers (`verify_agent_returned_in_phase`)
//!   whose marker may sit arbitrarily far back in a long autonomous
//!   flow's transcript.
//! - `read_recency_window` — capped at `TRANSCRIPT_BYTE_CAP` (50 MB).
//!   Used by per-turn recency walkers (`last_user_message_invokes_skill`,
//!   `most_recent_skill_in_user_only_set`,
//!   `most_recent_user_message_since_skill_action`,
//!   `most_recent_skill_since_user`, `any_skill_in_set_since_user`)
//!   where the marker of interest is among the most recent ~10,000
//!   turns and the hot path must stay bounded.
//! - `read_recent_turns` — capped at `SHARED_CONFIG_BLOCK_BYTE_CAP`
//!   (4 MB). Used by `recent_edit_blocked_on_shared_config` which
//!   only needs the latest assistant tool call and its paired
//!   tool_result.
//!
//! The private `read_capped` is the seek-and-take primitive both
//! `read_recency_window` and `read_recent_turns` wrap. Direct calls
//! to `read_capped` from production code outside this module are
//! forbidden — the contract test
//! `read_capped_only_called_inside_named_helpers` in
//! `tests/hooks/transcript_walker.rs` locks the invariant in, and
//! `.claude/rules/transcript-walker-cap.md` documents the API for
//! future authors.
//!
//! ## Gate normalization
//!
//! Per `.claude/rules/security-gates.md` "Normalize Before
//! Comparing", every gate-relevant string input is normalized
//! through `normalize_gate_input` (NUL strip + trim + ASCII
//! lowercase) before comparison. This applies to `skill` values,
//! transcript-extracted skill names, and turn-type discriminants.
//! Both sides of every comparison run through the same normalizer.
//!
//! ## Slash-command anchoring
//!
//! Layer 1's user-turn check parses `message.content` as a string
//! and requires the trimmed content to START with one of two
//! emission shapes Claude Code uses for user-typed slash commands:
//! the two-line shape
//! `<command-message><skill></command-message>\n<command-name>/<skill></command-name>`
//! (Claude Code 2.1.140+) OR the legacy one-line shape
//! `<command-name>/<skill></command-name>`. Both shapes are
//! checked via `starts_with` disjunction. A user typing
//! "what does <command-name>/flow:flow-abort</command-name> do?"
//! produces a content string where the marker appears mid-text —
//! that is prose mention, not a slash-command invocation, and is
//! rejected because the prose's leading bytes are neither
//! `<command-message>` nor `<command-name>`. Tool-result-wrapped
//! user turns (where `content` is an array of blocks rather than
//! a string) are also rejected because echoed assistant text in a
//! tool_result would otherwise authorize invocation of a
//! user-only skill.
//!
//! ## JSONL turn shape
//!
//! Mirrors `crate::session_metrics::read_transcript`. Each line is
//! a JSON object with a top-level `type` field whose value is
//! `"user"` or `"assistant"`. The line's payload lives under
//! `message.content` — a string for user-typed turns, an array of
//! content blocks (`{"type": "tool_use", "name": "Skill",
//! "input": {"skill": "..."}}`, etc.) for assistant turns and
//! tool_result-wrapped user turns. Lines that fail to parse as
//! JSON are skipped silently.
//!
//! ## Real vs synthetic user turns
//!
//! Claude Code emits two shapes of synthetic user turns alongside
//! the user-typed prose: tool_result-wrapped turns (array content)
//! and hook-injected feedback turns (string content with
//! `isMeta:true`). Walkers that need to find the most recent REAL
//! user turn must call `is_real_user_turn` and `continue` past
//! synthetic turns rather than stop at them. A walker that stops
//! at any user turn — or filters only on array content — silently
//! fails the moment a Stop-hook refusal lands ahead of the real
//! invocation. See `.claude/rules/transcript-shape.md` for the
//! catalog of synthetic shapes and the mechanical contract each
//! walker must satisfy.
//!
//! ## Imperative vs conversational real user turns
//!
//! Real (non-synthetic) user turns split further into two classes:
//! conversational prose (the user is talking to the model) and
//! imperative slash-command input (the user is invoking a slash
//! command via `<command-name>/<skill></command-name>` or the
//! two-line `<command-message>...</command-message>` shape). The
//! distinction matters only for
//! `most_recent_user_message_since_skill_action`, whose consumer
//! (`stop_continue::check_autonomous_stop`) uses the walker's
//! return to detect whether the user has typed a conversational
//! halt trigger. A slash-command turn is user-direction input,
//! not a conversation — treating it as halt-trigger prose would
//! permanently re-arm `_halt_pending` after every
//! `/flow:flow-continue` and trap the autonomous flow.
//!
//! Within imperative slash commands, `/flow:flow-continue` is the
//! universal resume directive: the walker also watermarks
//! preceding conversational prose to `None` so a user who first
//! paused with prose and then resumed with the slash command sees
//! the next Stop fire Rule 1 (encouraging refusal), not Rule 2 or
//! a fresh conversation pass-through.
//!
//! Every other walker in this module uses real-user-turn as a
//! *boundary* (where to stop scanning) rather than as a
//! *conversation signal* (whether the user wants to talk). The
//! imperative-vs-conversational discrimination lives in
//! `most_recent_user_message_since_skill_action` alone — see the
//! function's doc for the full rationale and
//! `.claude/rules/transcript-shape.md` "Real User Turns:
//! Imperative vs Conversational Shapes" for the discipline
//! authored at the rule layer.
//! `.claude/rules/autonomous-phase-discipline.md` "Conversation
//! pass-through" carries the consumer-side picture.

///   `read_full`), OR `agent`/`phase` normalize to an empty string,
///   OR the file cannot be read / parsed at all. The verifier reads

///   `phase-enter` marker for a long-running phase can sit
///   arbitrarily far back; a tail-bounded read would silently miss
///   it on autonomous flows whose transcript grows past the cap.
/// - `"tool_use_missing"` — no Agent tool_use with
///   `input.subagent_type == "flow:<agent>"` appears AFTER the most
///   recent phase-enter marker.
/// - `"tool_result_missing"` — the Agent tool_use was found but no
///   matching `tool_result` with the same `tool_use_id` appears
///   AFTER the marker.
///
/// The verifier anchors at the LAST phase-enter marker for `phase` so
/// agent invocations from a prior pass through the phase (rare, but

///
/// ## Three classes of real user turn
///
/// Per `.claude/rules/transcript-shape.md`, transcript JSONL
/// carries two synthetic user-turn shapes alongside user-typed
/// prose. This walker further partitions real (non-synthetic)
/// user turns into two sub-classes:
///
/// - **Conversational prose** — string content not matching the
///   slash-command emission shape. The user is talking to the
///   model. Captured as `candidate`.
/// - **Imperative slash-command input** — string content
///   beginning with `<command-message>` or `<command-name>`. The
///   user is invoking a slash command, not conversing. Filtered
///   from candidate capture. When the slash-command names
///   `flow:flow-continue`, the walker additionally watermarks
///   the prior `candidate` to `None` because the resume directive
///   is the user answering whatever pause their preceding prose
///   triggered — preserving that prose would re-arm the halt
///   contract on the next Stop event and trap the autonomous
///   flow in a permanent voluntary-stop state.
///
/// Other slash commands (e.g. `/flow:flow-abort`) are filtered
/// from candidate capture but do NOT watermark preceding prose:
/// only `/flow:flow-continue` is the universal resume directive,
/// so preserving the user's prose lets the user combine "pause
/// to talk" with "and also abort" without losing the
/// conversational signal.
///
/// ## Production consumer
///
/// `check_autonomous_stop` in `src/hooks/stop_continue.rs`. The
/// predicate uses the returned content to detect whether the
/// user has typed a new prose message since the model last took
/// a Skill action. Per
/// `.claude/rules/autonomous-phase-discipline.md` "The Two-Exit
/// Halt Model", a `Some` return triggers the conversation
/// pass-through (set `_halt_pending=true`, allow the Stop so the
/// model can answer); a `None` return triggers Rule 1 (refuse
/// the Stop with the encouraging message). The slash-command
/// filter and the `/flow:flow-continue` watermark are what give
/// `/flow:flow-continue` its universal-resume semantics — they
/// ensure the next Stop after a resume fires Rule 1, not Rule 2
/// or a fresh pass-through, regardless of whether the original
/// halt was triggered by user prose or by a system event.
///
/// ## Validation contract
///
/// Per `.claude/rules/external-input-path-construction.md`,
/// `transcript_path` runs through
/// `crate::session_metrics::is_safe_transcript_path` (rejects
/// empty, NUL-byte, relative, ParentDir-component, and prefix-
/// escaping paths). File reads are bounded by `read_recency_window`
/// (50 MB tail) so a corrupted or hostile transcript cannot cause
/// unbounded I/O on the per-turn hot path.
///
/// `home` is passed in (rather than read from `$HOME` inside) so
/// fixture-controlled tests can isolate from the real user
/// environment per `.claude/rules/testing-gotchas.md`.
