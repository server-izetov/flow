//! Stop hook composed of three predicates that may refuse a turn-end.
//!
//! `run()` evaluates them in order:
//!
//! 1. `check_in_progress_utility_skill` — when a multi-step utility
//!    skill (`flow:flow-plan`) wrote a per-session marker at
//!    `<home>/.claude/flow/utility-in-progress-<id>.json` AND the
//!    decompose skill (bare `decompose` or namespaced
//!    `decompose:decompose`) is the most recent Skill `tool_use` in
//!    the persisted transcript since the most recent real user
//!    turn, refuses turn-end so the model continues from
//!    decompose's return straight to filing.
//! 2. `check_continue` — on subsequent stops, forces continuation
//!    when `_continue_pending=<skill_name>` is set, supporting
//!    multi-child-skill chains.
//! 3. `check_autonomous_stop` — the unified autonomous-mode gate.
//!    Three rules:
//!    - **Rule 1 (no halt, no user message, autonomous phase
//!      in-progress).** Refuse a voluntary turn-end with the
//!      encouraging "Stop Refused" message. The autonomous flow
//!      must keep going.
//!    - **Rule 2 (`_halt_pending=true`, no new user message).**
//!      Refuse with a message naming `/flow:flow-continue` and
//!      `/flow:flow-abort` as the only exits. Persists across
//!      every subsequent Stop until the user types
//!      `/flow:flow-continue` to clear the halt.
//!    - **Conversation pass-through (user message detected since
//!      the last Skill action).** Set `_halt_pending=true` and
//!      ALLOW the Stop so the model can answer the user. The next
//!      Stop without a new user message blocks under Rule 2.
//!
//!    See `.claude/rules/autonomous-phase-discipline.md` "Explicit
//!    User Pause Directives" for the design.
//!
//! Fail-open with error reporting: any error allows the stop (exit 0,
//! no block output), but writes a diagnostic to stderr and attempts to
//! log to `.flow-states/<branch>.log` for post-mortem visibility.

/// AND the decompose skill (bare `decompose` or namespaced
/// `decompose:decompose`) is the most recent Skill call since the
/// user typed.
///
/// **Two-signal gate.** The block decision requires BOTH:
///
/// 1. The per-session utility marker file at
///    `<home>/.claude/flow/utility-in-progress-<session_id>.json`
///    exists with matching skill name and session_id (precondition).
/// 2. `crate::hooks::transcript_walker::most_recent_skill_since_user`
///    returns the decompose skill — bare `decompose` or namespaced
///    `decompose:decompose`, both recognized by `is_decompose_skill`
///    — for the supplied `transcript_path` (the discriminator).
///
/// The transcript walker discriminates "decompose just returned
/// mid-pipeline" (block) from "model just sent a normal
/// conversational reply" (no block). Without the discriminator,
/// every reply during discussion mode would refuse turn-end and the
/// discussion-mode contract these skills offer would not hold.
///
/// **Last-Skill-wins semantics.** When a planning-persona sub-agent
/// (`flow:pm`, `flow:tech-lead`, `flow:cto`) is invoked AFTER
/// `decompose:decompose` in the same window, the walker returns the
/// most recent Skill name and the gate falls through to no_block.
/// The user reacts in the next message and discussion continues.
///
/// Hook-state read timing per `.claude/rules/hook-state-timing.md`:
///
/// - **Field read.** Marker file existence + JSON `skill` and
///   `session_id`. Transcript file content via
///   `most_recent_skill_since_user`.
/// - **Writer.** `bin/flow set-utility-in-progress` writes the
///   marker; Claude Code writes transcript turns as the session
///   advances.
/// - **Clearer.** `bin/flow clear-utility-in-progress` removes the
///   marker at the skill's COMPLETE banner. The transcript is not
///   cleared — older turns remain visible but the walker stops at
///   the most recent real user turn.
/// - **Read window.** Every Stop event during the skill lifecycle.
///   The gate fires on every iteration of a decompose-then-file
///   loop because each iteration produces a new decompose call as
///   the most recent Skill in the transcript.
///
/// Composed FIRST in `run()`, before `check_continue` and
/// `check_autonomous_stop`.
///
/// **Block message.** When the gate fires, the context is the exact
