//!    main repo when the working directory is inside a FLOW worktree, directing
//!    the caller to use the worktree copy instead.
//! 2. **Shared config protection** — blocks Edit/Write calls on shared
//!    configuration files (`.gitignore`, `Cargo.toml`, `.github/`, etc.) when
//!    the CWD is inside a `.worktrees/` directory (the flow-active proxy).
//!    Only Edit and Write tool names trigger the block — Read/Glob/Grep are
//!    allowed so codebase exploration is not impacted. The block message

//! Fires on Edit, Write, Read, Glob, and Grep tool calls.
