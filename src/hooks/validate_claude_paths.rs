//! PreToolUse hook that blocks Edit/Write on:
//!
//! 1. `.claude/rules/`, `.claude/skills/`, and `CLAUDE.md` — only during
//!    active FLOW phases. Redirects to `bin/flow write-rule`.
//! 2. `~/.claude/projects/` (the Claude Code persisted transcript root,
//!    which also houses the auto-memory directory) — in ALL contexts,
//!    not just active flows. The matcher walks the path components and
//!    fires whenever any segment matches `.claude` followed by
//!    `projects` (case-insensitive), covering the entire subtree —
//!    transcript JSONLs, memory files, and any future descendant.
//!    Transcript tampering could subvert `validate-skill`'s user-only
//!    block by injecting a fake user `<command-name>` line, so the
//!    block fires regardless of flow state. Reads remain allowed
//!    because the transcript walkers in `validate-skill` and
//!    `validate-ask-user` need to scan the file themselves; the hook
//!    is registered for Edit/Write tools only in `hooks/hooks.json`.
//!
//!    The block message leads with a redirect to
//!    `bin/flow write-rule --path .claude/rules/<topic>.md` so a
//!    behavioral constraint the model wanted to persist as memory has
//!    a concrete path to land as a project rule instead. The message
//!    points at `.claude/rules/persistence-routing.md` as the routing
//!    decision tree.
//!
//! Fires on Edit and Write tool calls.
//!
//! Exit 0 — allow (path is not protected, or no FLOW phase active and
