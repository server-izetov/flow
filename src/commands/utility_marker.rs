//! Per-session "utility skill in progress" marker file.
//!
//! Multi-step utility skills (`flow:flow-plan`,
//! `flow:flow-decompose-project`) invoke `decompose:decompose` via
//! the Skill tool mid-skill. The Skill tool's return is a structural
//! surface where the model treats the handoff as a natural stopping
//! point and returns control to the user — breaking the unattended-
//! flow contract these skills promise to their consumers.
//!
//! `write_marker` (called immediately after the skill's Announce
//! banner) and `clear_marker` (called immediately before the COMPLETE
//! banner and on every error-exit path) keep a JSON marker on disk at
//! `<home>/.claude/flow/utility-in-progress-<session_id>.json` for the
//! skill's full lifecycle. The marker is a **precondition** for the
//! Stop hook's block — necessary but not sufficient. The Stop hook
//! ALSO consults `crate::hooks::transcript_walker::most_recent_skill_since_user`
//! to confirm `decompose:decompose` is the most recent Skill call
//! since the user last typed. Both signals must align before
//! `{"decision":"block"}` fires: a normal conversational reply with
//! no decompose call in flight ends the turn cleanly even while
//! the marker is present.
//!
//! The marker is per-session (not per-flow): it lives under the
//! user's HOME, not `.flow-states/`, because the multi-step utility
//! skills run outside any active FLOW phase. Concurrent Claude Code
//! sessions each get their own marker file because the filename
//! includes `session_id`, so cleaning up after a crashed session is a
//! no-op for other live sessions.
//!
//! Tests live at `tests/commands/utility_marker.rs` per
//! `.claude/rules/test-placement.md` — no inline `#[cfg(test)]` here.
