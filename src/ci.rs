//! `bin/flow ci` — repo-local CI orchestrator.
//!
//! Runs format → lint → build → test in sequence by execing the
//! corresponding `./bin/<tool>` scripts in the current working
//! directory. Each repo owns its actual command strings; FLOW
//! contributes the sentinel-based dirty-check optimization,
//! retry/flaky classification, the `FLOW_CI_RUNNING` recursion
//! guard, and a stable JSON output contract.
//!
//! By default, skips if nothing changed since the last passing run.
//! With `--force`, always runs regardless of sentinel state.
//! With `--retry N`, runs up to N times with force semantics and
//! classifies failures as flaky (passes on retry) or consistent
//! (all attempts fail). With `--simulate-branch`, sets
//! FLOW_SIMULATE_BRANCH in the child environment so current_branch()
//! returns the simulated name during test execution. The simulated
//! branch name is incorporated into the sentinel snapshot hash so runs
//! with different --simulate-branch values produce distinct sentinels.
//!
//! Output (JSON to stdout):
//!   Success:       {"status": "ok", "skipped": false}
//!   Skipped:       {"status": "ok", "skipped": true, "reason": "..."}
//!   Error:         {"status": "error", "message": "..."}
//!   Retry pass:    {"status": "ok", "attempts": 1}
//!   Retry flaky:   {"status": "ok", "attempts": 2, "flaky": true, "first_failure_output": "..."}
//!   Retry fail:    {"status": "error", "attempts": 3, "consistent": true, "output": "..."}
//!
//! Tests live at `tests/ci.rs` per
//! `.claude/rules/test-placement.md` — no inline `#[cfg(test)]` in
//! this file.
