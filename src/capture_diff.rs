//! Capture the worktree diff against `origin/<base>` for the Review
//! sub-agents.
//!
//! The `capture-diff` subcommand replaces the inline `git diff` the
//! flow-review skill previously embedded in each agent prompt. The
//! diff is captured once and written to canonical
//! `.flow-states/<branch>/full-diff.diff` and
//! `.flow-states/<branch>/substantive-diff.diff` files; agents read
//! the files via the Read tool instead of receiving the diff bytes
//! through their prompt. Keeps the parent skill's prompt budget
//! bounded as PR size grows so the four review agents do not
//! starve their own investigation budgets.
//!
//! Optionally, one or more `--family <pathspec>` arguments write a
//! whitespace-filtered diff scoped to each pathspec to
//! `.flow-states/<branch>/substantive-diff-<sanitized>.diff` and record
//! the paths in the success envelope's `family_slices` array. The
//! flow-review read-overflow remediation uses this to slice the diff
//! per directory family so each documentation-agent re-invocation reads
//! a bounded per-family file rather than the whole substantive diff.
