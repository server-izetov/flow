//! Centralized construction for FLOW-managed paths.
//!
//! Two types cover the `.flow-states/` access patterns, plus a free
//! function for `.worktrees/<branch>/` boundary computation:
//!
//! - `FlowStatesDir` — directory-only. Use for cross-branch operations
//!   (discovery scans, hook prefix checks, pre-lock queue paths) that
//!   need the `.flow-states/` directory without a specific branch.
//! - `FlowPaths` — branch-scoped. Use when addressing a per-branch
//!   file (`state_file`, `log_file`, `plan_file`, etc.). The only
//!   constructor is `try_new`, an `Option`-returning variant that
//!   filters branches via `is_valid_branch` so empty,
//!   slash-containing, NUL-bearing, and `.`/`..` traversal segments
//!   never reach path construction. Callers that hold a branch known
//!   to be valid upstream call `try_new(...).expect("<boundary>")`
//!   with a doc-comment naming the upstream sanitizer; callers that
//!   receive a branch from git or a CLI override pattern-match on
//!   the `Option` and treat `None` as "no active flow".
//! - `compute_worktree_paths` / `compute_worktree_root` — derive the
//!   project root and worktree root from any cwd inside the worktree.
//!   `compute_worktree_paths` returns `Option<(project_root, worktree_root)>`
//!   for callers (the worktree-paths hook) that need both. The thin
//!   wrapper `compute_worktree_root` returns just the worktree root
//!   for callers (`ci::run_impl`) that only need to normalize cwd to
//!   the worktree boundary. Both are anchored on a leading `/` and
//!   match the rightmost occurrence so a project path containing
//!   `.worktrees/` as a non-marker component does not produce a false
//!   match.
//!
//! `FlowPaths` also exposes `flow_states_dir()` for callers that
//! already hold a branch-scoped instance and incidentally need the
//! directory — standalone directory access belongs in `FlowStatesDir`.
//! Filename suffixes live here so the on-disk layout can change by
//! editing this module alone.
