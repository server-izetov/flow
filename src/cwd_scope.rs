//! Cwd drift guard for state-mutating subcommands.
//!
//! When a flow is started from a subdirectory of a mono-repo, the
//! state file captures `relative_cwd` (e.g. `"api"` for a flow started
//! inside `<repo>/api/`). The skill cds the agent into
//! `<worktree>/<relative_cwd>` after worktree creation. Every
//! `bin/flow` subcommand then enforces that cwd against the captured
//! value via [`enforce`] — if the user has cd'd outside the expected
//! subdirectory, the subcommand hard-errors with a message naming the
//! expected directory.
//!
//! Tests live at tests/cwd_scope.rs per .claude/rules/test-placement.md —
//! no inline #[cfg(test)] in this file.
//!
//! # Why this matters
//!
//! Without the guard, a user who cds out of `api/` into `ios/` and runs
//! `bin/flow ci` would silently run CI for the wrong subdirectory of the
//! mono-repo. The guard catches the drift before any tool runs and tells
//! the user where they should be.
//!
//! # Backwards compatibility
//!
//! The guard is a no-op when:
//!
//! - `cwd` is not in a git worktree (no branch resolution)
//! - The current branch has no state file (no active FLOW flow)
//! - The state file's `relative_cwd` is empty (root-level flow) AND
//!   `cwd` equals the worktree root
//!
//! Existing flows that pre-date this field default to empty
//! `relative_cwd` and continue to work without modification.

/// 1. Resolve the current branch from `cwd` via `current_branch_in`. If
///    detached HEAD or non-git, return Ok(()) (no enforcement).
/// 2. Read the state file at `<project_root>/.flow-states/<branch>.json`.
///    If missing, unreadable (e.g. directory at that path), or
///    unparseable, return Ok(()) (no active flow / fail-open).
/// 3. Read `relative_cwd` from the state file. Default to empty.
/// 4. Compute the worktree root via `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`.
///    current_branch_in succeeded so cwd is a live git-managed
///    directory — `--show-toplevel` succeeding is a hard invariant,
///    enforced via `.expect()`. Any failure here signals a race or a
///    broken git install.
/// 5. Compute `expected = <worktree_root>/<relative_cwd>` (just
///    `<worktree_root>` when empty).
/// 6. Canonicalize `cwd` and `expected` and check that `cwd` is inside
///    (or equal to) `expected`. If `cwd` is outside, return Err with
///    a message naming the expected directory.
///
/// The check is a prefix match on canonical paths, so descending into
/// subdirectories of `expected` is allowed (e.g. a root-level flow may
/// cd into any worktree directory; an `api`-scoped flow may cd into
/// `api/src/` but not into `ios/`).
///
/// `project_root` is the main repo root (where `.flow-states/` lives).
/// `cwd` is the subcommand's current working directory.
