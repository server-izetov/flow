//! Authoritative per-phase required-agent set.
//!
//! The `phase-finalize` required-agents gate composes the set returned
//! by [`required_agents_for_phase`] against
//! `phases.<phase>.agents_returned` (recorded by
//! `bin/flow record-agent-return` after the calling skill verifies an
//! agent's clean return) and `phases.<phase>.agents_skipped`. A phase
//! with any required agent that neither returned nor was skipped fails
//! finalize with `reason: "required_agent_not_returned"`.
//!
//! The constant is bound to the matching SKILL.md agent-invocation set
//! by `tests/skill_contracts.rs::required_agents_matches_skill_invocations`.
//! A SKILL.md edit that adds, removes, or renames an
//! `subagent_type: "flow:<name>"` invocation without updating this
//! constant fails the contract test.

/// Phase keyed slice of required agent names. Each agent name matches
/// the `<name>` portion of a `subagent_type: "flow:<name>"` invocation
/// in the phase's SKILL.md. Agent names are stored lowercase so the
/// `is_known_agent` lookup matches `normalize_gate_input` callers.
