//! `bin/flow add-skipped-agent` — record a skipped review-agent in
//! `phases.<phase>.agents_skipped` so `phase-finalize` can gate
//! completion when one or more agents were skipped during the
//! phase.
//!
//! Invoked by `flow-review` Step 2's failure-classification logic
//! when an agent's response carries canonical external-failure
//! markers (rate-limit messages, API errors, etc.) and no
//! structured `**Finding` block. The Done handler in `flow-review`
//! then sees the field populated and surfaces the
//! `agents_skipped` error reason from `phase-finalize` to the user
//! for retry / accept / abort.
//!
//! Tests live at `tests/add_skipped_agent.rs` per
//! `.claude/rules/test-placement.md`.

/// `exhausted_retries` records an agent that the calling skill
/// (flow-review Step 2, flow-learn Step 1) tried to invoke but gave
/// up on after exceeding the retry cap (3 attempts) — the agent
/// either truncated repeatedly, returned an external-failure marker,
/// or failed transcript verification through
/// `record-agent-return`. The phase-finalize required-agents gate
/// (added in a later task) reads both `agents_returned` and
/// `agents_skipped` so an exhausted-retry agent counts as
/// accounted-for in the same way an `api_error`-skipped agent does.
///
/// **v1 boundary — skip reasons are procedural, not
/// transcript-verified.** Unlike `record-agent-return` (which
/// verifies via the persisted JSONL that an `Agent` `tool_use` +
/// matching `tool_result` pair appears since the phase-enter
/// marker), the skip path here writes the entry unconditionally. A
/// model that calls `add-skipped-agent --reason exhausted_retries`
/// without having actually retried three times satisfies the
/// `agents_skipped` gate the same way a legitimate `api_error`
/// entry does. The audit closure runs at Learn: each
/// `exhausted_retries` entry is paired with a
/// `state.notes` entry of kind `agent_exhausted_retries`
/// (carrying attempt count + evidence pointer), which Learn
/// surfaces in its "Missing analyses" report. Procedural
/// enforcement of the retry cap lives in the calling SKILL.md's
/// retry-3-then-note loop; a future PR may mechanically gate
/// `exhausted_retries` against
/// `phases.<phase>.agent_retry_counts.<agent> >= 3`, but that
/// tightening is out of scope for v1.
